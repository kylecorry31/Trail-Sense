If you choose to write a new feature yourself, send me a message to verify that it is something that I will accept into Trail Sense before your write it (if not, you can always fork this repo and create your own version of Trail Sense). I will conduct a code review on incoming pull requests to verify they align nicely with the rest of the code base and the feature works as intended.

Issues marked with the help-wanted label are open for community contribution at any time. Please leave a comment on the issue stating that you are working on it or ask for more details. If possible, try to give me a timeline so I know which release it should be tagged as. Once you decide to work on one of the help-wanted issues, just submit a PR to main and I will conduct a code review.

If you would like to work on an issue that isn't marked with help-wanted, please let me know because it may not have all the details, I may not want it implemented yet, or I may want to implement it myself. As of April 28, 2024 all issues are correctly tagged with help-wanted.

If you submit an issue, please be civil and constructive - I will consider all feedback, and if I choose not to implement your suggestion I will post my reasoning. If you are experiencing an issue, please include all relevant details to help me understand and reproduce the issue. If you disagree with a change, please describe why you disagree and how I can improve it. Finally, if applicable, please provide research / evidence so I can cross verify.

All contributors will be credited in the Licenses section of Trail Sense setting (updated weekly).

## Survival Guide
The survival guide is heavily curated and all information must be easy to follow and relevant to wilderness survival for the average person. I do not want to include advanced topics or bushcraft in the guide.

I may publish and sell a physical copy of the survival guide at some point, so I ask that all content is written by me. I'm open to suggestions for areas to improve or add.
