This chapter discusses one of the isolated person's most urgent requirements. The isolated person must remember that the three essentials of survival-water, food, and shelter-are prioritized according to their estimate of the situation. We can live for weeks without food but it may take days or weeks to determine what is safe to eat and to trap animals in the area. Therefore, you need to begin food gathering in the earliest stages of isolation.

## Food considerations

4-1. Although you can live several weeks without food, you need an adequate amount to stay healthy. Without food, your mental and physical capabilities will deteriorate rapidly and you will become weak. Food provides energy and replenishes the substances that your body burns. Food provides vitamins, minerals, salts, and other elements essential to good health. Possibly more important, it helps morale.

4-2. The three basic sources of food are plants, animals (including fish and sea life), and commercial rations. In varying degrees, all three provide the calories, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins needed for normal daily body functions. Commercial rations should be saved to augment plant and animal foods, which will extend and help maintain a balanced diet.

4-3. The average person needs 2,000 calories per day to function at a minimum level. An adequate amount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins without an adequate caloric intake will lead to starvation and cannibalism of the body's own tissue for energy. Signs of malnutrition/starvation include the following:

- Loss of body fat.

- Difficulty breathing.

- Lower body temperature.

- Reduced muscle mass.

- Fatigue.

- Longer healing time for wounds and illness.

**NUTRITION**

4-4. From the moment a piece of food enters the mouth, each bite is broken down and used by the body. Metabolism is the series of chemical reactions that transform food into components that can be used for the body's basic processes. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, and vitamins are vital to proper function of the body.

**Carbohydrates**

4-5. Carbohydrates provide an immediate source of energy, or are stored for future use. When stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles they remain an effective and efficient energy source.

4-6. Excess calories from carbohydrates (just like excess protein and fat) convert to fat and serve as an energy source for future activity. Because of their role as a primary fuel source for physical and cognitive activity 45 percent to 65 percent of your calories should come from carbohydrates. Good sources of carbohydrates include fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products.

**Fats**

4-7. Fats are over twice as calorically dense as carbohydrates and protein and can provide an important source of energy. Fats come in many forms and are essential for normal body function. In addition to being a good energy source, fats play a key regulatory role in numerous biological functions and serve as a carrier for the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and carotenoids. The recommended total fat intake is between 20 and 35 percent of calories. Animal flesh, seeds, and nuts are all good sources of fat.

**Proteins**

4-8. Protein is the major structural component of all cells. Major functions include rebuilding muscle and repairing tissue. Proteins are made up of amino acids. Those that contain adequate proportions of all essential amino acids are considered complete proteins. Complete proteins include meat sources, dairy and eggs. While most plants do not contain complete protein, eating a variety of sources of incomplete protein will ensure the body receives the essential amino acids it needs. Foods that are not complete proteins but are still good sources of protein include beans, nuts and seeds.

**Vitamins**

4-9. Vitamins occur in small quantities in many foods and are essential for normal growth and health. Their chief function is to regulate the body processes. Vitamins can generally be placed into two groups: fat-soluble and water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (D, E, A, K) need fat and minerals for absorption and storage in the body's fat and liver. Water-soluble vitamins (all except those listed previously) need frequent replenishing. The body only stores slight amounts of the water-soluble type. During a long isolating event where a routinely balanced diet is not available, an isolated person must overcome food aversions and eat as much of a variety of vitamin-rich foods as possible. Often one or more of the basic food groups (protein, grains, dairy, vegetables and fruits) are not available in the form of familiar foods, and vitamin deficiencies such as beriberi or scurvy result.

**Minerals**

4-10. There are two categories of minerals: (major minerals and micro or trace minerals) both of which are essential for critical structural elements, controlling the action of nerves and muscles, maintenance of the body's water balance and the regulation of multiple essential bodily functions. Common examples of minerals include sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, and iron. The impact of a mineral deficiency can include poor body water regulation, compromised immune function, an increase the prevalence of infection and physical and cognitive decrements.

**FOOD AVAILABILITY**

4-11. Operational environments play a significant role in determining how much food an isolated person requires. In cold environments, more calories will be required to maintain necessary body heat. In hot environments, more water and less food will be required to meet their needs. Isolated personnel should learn what and how to consume and ration their food and water. If they are low on water (less than one quart a day), they should stay away from starchy, dry, salty food sources. These types of items will require more water to digest and increase thirst. Consuming foods with high carbohydrate content is best for water conservation, while high protein foods tend to require more water for digestion.

**Plants**

4-12. Plant foods provide carbohydrates-the main source of energy. Many plants provide enough protein to keep the body at normal efficiency. Although plants may not provide a balanced diet, they will sustain you even in the arctic, where meat's heat producing qualities are normally essential. Many plant foods such as nuts and seeds will give you enough protein and oils for normal efficiency. Roots, green vegetables, and plant foods containing natural sugar will provide calories and carbohydrates that give the body natural energy.

4-13. The food value of plants becomes more and more important if you are eluding the enemy or if you are in an area, where wildlife is scarce. For instance-

- You can dry plants by wind, air, sun, or fire. This retards spoilage so that you can store or carry the plant food with you to use when needed.

- You can obtain plants more easily and more quietly than meat. This is extremely important when the enemy is near.

**Animals**

4-14. Meat is more nourishing than plant food. In fact, it may even be more readily available in some places. However, to get meat, you need to know the habits of and how to capture the various wildlife. To satisfy your immediate food needs, first seek the more abundant and more easily obtained wildlife, such as insects, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and reptiles. These can satisfy your immediate hunger while you are preparing traps and snares for larger game. General considerations for animals includes the following-

- Insects are plentiful and very easy to forage. Insects live close to the ground under logs and rocks, and in underground colonies.

- Fish are procured by the use of items such as hooks, fishing line, weights, spears, or lures. Knowledge of fishing techniques will give isolated persons the edge when procuring fish. Basic principles of how fish react and how to trap, prepare, and consume them will provide a plentiful source of food near fresh or saltwater areas.

4-15. Small mammals, such as rabbits, prairie dogs, and rats, often inhabit arid regions. Look in the shade or in underground burrows to protect themselves from the sun and heat. Small animals such as rodents usually live in desert caves or rock outcroppings. Smoke sometimes works to force small animals, such as rabbits, out of their burrows. Placing traps and snares at openings of these burrows is the best method to catch them.

**BASIC FOOD PREPARATION**

4-16. Once plants are identified as edible, they need only be washed to ensure that all potential fertilizer or other toxins are rinsed off. The foliage is then cut up into usable pieces and either consume raw or cook the material as needed.

4-17. Clean and eat sea life as soon as possible to avoid spoilage. Preserve leftover meat by drying or smoking. Use the internal parts as bait for future fishing opportunities.

4-18. Sea birds have proven to be a useful source of food. Skin freshly killed birds, rather than plucking, to remove oil glands. The meat is edible raw, sundried, or cooked. The gullet contents can be a good food source. Eat the flesh or preserve immediately after cleaning. The viscera, along with any other unused parts, makes good fish bait.

4-19. Game food should be fully prepared with the least amount of effort and exertion. Almost every part of game food can be consumed. Skinning and butchering should be done so that all edible meat can be saved. Cutting large animals up into smaller pieces will assist in moving the meat closer to where isolated persons are camped. When removing the skin of an animal, isolated persons must decide if they are going to use the hide to improvise an item like a piece of clothing or a water bag, or if they will just discard the skin after it is removed. If it is to be discarded, a rough skinning job can be completed. The best time to butcher and skin an animal is right after it is killed. At that time, the animal is still hydrated and the skin will come off the easiest. The internal organs can spoil the rest of the meat if not removed in a timely fashion. If the animal is killed late in the day, the organs can be removed and the rest of the butchering can be done at a later time. An effort should be made to secure the carcass from predators.

4-20. When butchering an animal, all edible fat should be saved-especially in colder climates where an isolated person's diet might consist of only lean meat. Fat should be eaten to provide for a more balanced and complete diet.

4-21. Small game skinning of animals like squirrels, rabbits, and other small-size game begins with removing the entrails. This is done by splitting the body open and pulling them out with the fingers. This should also include the chest cavity.

4-22. During preparation, ensure that all items used for their processing and preparations like tools and cutting surfaces are cleaned well. Avoid cross contamination with other foods, improper handling of raw meat can spread bacteria and make the isolated person ill. Prevent raw juices from raw meat and seafood from dripping onto other food during the storage and preparation process. Wash hands before and after food handling to minimize the chances of spreading bacteria that could make the isolated person ill. Prepare a sanitizer by putting one teaspoon of liquid bleach per one quart of water. Use this to wash down all contaminated surfaces. Leave the solution on the surfaces for a full tem minutes before rinsing off.

Note. There is less work and less wear on cutting implements if the ribs are broken first, then the breaks are cut.

## Basic cooking and preservation methods

4-23. Fully cook wild game, large insects, freshwater fish, clams, mussels, snails and crawfish to kill any internal parasites. Mince mussels and large snails to make them tender for consumption. Cooking these items will also improve the taste and, in some cases, allow the isolated person to stretch out how much food they have (for example, turning a small rabbit into a large stew). Cooking will also slow the decomposition of food but will not eliminate it.

4-24. In some cases, cooking food properly can produce more calories from the food, as in the case of starches. Cooked starches have more calories for use as energy than raw starches. Cooking in many cases can destroy harmful anti-nutrients that bind minerals. The destruction of these anti-nutrients can assist in the absorption of beneficial nutrient food compounds. Cooking will destroy many bacteria that are present which work to break the food down causing it to spoil faster.

4-25. Cooking methods that are the best for immediate consumption and provide the most nutrition are the least effective for food preservation. Reheat, boiled and steamed food every day until fully consumed. The danger zone for food bacteria growth is between 40 and 140° F. Heat meat to an internal temperature of 180° F. When food is reheated, it should be heated to an internal temperature of at least 165° F. The symptoms of food borne illness like diarrhea or vomiting can cause severe dehydration and can be serious to the isolated person.

**LEACHING**

4-26. Leaching food is a technique that is used to prepare food for cooking by removing unwanted substances that are water-soluble minerals like potassium, for example. Removing bad tastes from food and softening food are other benefits of leaching. Placing cleaned and shelled acorns in a clean fast flowing stream will remove tannic acid from acorns or wild asparagus so it can then be roasted and consumed. If no stream is available, leaching can be done by soaking food in several changes of water.

**BOILING**

4-27. Boiling is a high heat cooking technique and is the most nutritious, simplest, and safest method of cooking (see figure 4-1 on page 4-5\). Boiling allows the isolated person to heat and moisten plants and meat breaking them down and making them more easily digestible. Boiling allows all the nutrients to stay in the broth of the stew. It allows the addition of plants and water to the mixture to increase the amount of food and improve the taste. Isolated persons can eat the meat and plants plus hydrate and receive nutrients from the leftover broth. Boiling works well for feeding larger groups.

4-28. Numerous containers can be used for boiling. For example, suspend a metal container above, or set beside, a heat source to boil foods. Green bamboo makes an excellent cooking container.

**Parboiling** 

4-29. Parboiling is the partial boiling of food. Parboiling is used to remove foul-tasting substances from food. Parboiling softens foods that are going to be cooked in another way like baking or grilling.

**Steaming**

4-30. Steaming is an indirect heat method of cooking that works by using boiling water to produce steam and then using that steam to cook the food. For example, a metal container suspended above, or set beside, a heat source to boil foods. Green bamboo makes an excellent cooking container.

**Stone boiling**

4-31. Stone boiling is a method of boiling using superheated rocks and a container that holds water but cannot be suspended over an open flame. Examples of these containers are survival kit containers, a helmet, a hole in the ground lined with waterproof material, or a hollow log. The container is filled with food and water and then heated with superhot stones until the water boils. Stones from a stream or damp area should not be used. The moisture in the stones may turn to steam and cause the stones to explode while they are being heated in the fire. The container should be covered and new stones added as the water stops boiling. The rocks can be removed with the aid of a wire secured to the rock before being put into the container or two sticks used in a chopstick fashion.

**Figure 4-1. Boiling**

**BAKING**

4-32. Baking is a good method of cooking as it is slow and allows the food's nutrients to stay in the container, retaining a large amount of the moisture in the food and making tough meat tender and easier to consume. Baking is often used with various types of ovens. Ovens that can be improvised in the field include the bank oven. This is produced when the isolated person finds the bank of a river or hill with clay dirt. The isolated person will go to the top of the bank and put a stick in the ground about two feet back from the bank drop off. This will create the hole for the chimney so the oven can breathe. Then at the banks face, a hole will be dug for the cooking compartment with a small opening and a larger interior space. Once the hole is dug, the isolated person can build a fire inside the cooking compartment to cure it. A door can be made from a large rock or green log. Before use, heat up a set of coals, place inside the oven and begin to bake.

**Reflector Oven**

4-33. The reflector oven works well for baking and is easy to make. Just build a framework that will reflect the intense heat from a fire. To improve the effectiveness of the oven the isolated person can add angles to the framework and if available add a lining of aluminum foil to intensify the reflection capability. Build a fire in front of the reflector achieving a nice set of coals. Place the food on top of the coals, keep the fire stoked, and bake. Temperature control for ovens can be measured and adjusted with the use of flour made out of dried plant grains or seeds.

**Baking with Leaves**

4-34. Foods can be baked by wrapping in wet leaves (avoid using a type of plant that will give an unpleasant flavor to what is being cooked), placed inside a metal container, or packed with mud or clay and placed directly on the coals. Fish and birds packed in mud and baked must not be skinned because the scales, skin, or feathers will come off the animal when the mud or clay is removed. Clambake-style baking is done by heating a number of stones in a fire and allowing the fire to burn down to coals.

4-35. A layer of wet seaweed or leaves is then placed over the hot rocks. Food such as mussels and clams in their shells are then placed on the wet seaweed or leaves. More wet seaweed or leaves and soil is used as a cover. When thoroughly steamed in their juices, clam, oyster, and mussel shells will open and may be eaten without further preparation.

**ROASTING**

4-36. Roasting food is a less desirable method of cooking because it involves exposing food to direct heat. This can quickly destroy the nutritional properties of the food. The fire will not only dry out the food-it will also cause the food's very important juices to cook out and end up in the fire. Putting a piece of food on a stick and placing it over a fire is considered roasting. Planking is another form of roasting. This involves meat, which can be cooked on a flat surface such as a rock, a board, or a piece of bamboo. This surface is propped up next to the fire. The radiant heat from the fire cooks the meat. The meat will need to be turned over to thoroughly cook both sides.

**FRYING**

4-37. Frying is the least favorable method of preparing food. Nearly all of the natural juices are cooked out of the meat, which tends to make it tough, and some of the meat's nutritional value will be destroyed. Frying can be done on any nonporous surface which can be heated. Examples are unpainted metal from an aircraft, vehicle parts, large seashells, flat rocks, and some survival kits.

## Preserving food

4-38. Preserving food is very important for isolated persons. Food, especially meat, has a tendency to spoil within a short period of time, unless it is preserved. There are many ways to preserve food including cooking, refrigeration, freezing, and dehydration.

4-39. Cooling is an effective method of storing food for short periods. Heat tends to accelerate the decomposition process where cooling retards decomposition. The colder food becomes, the less likely it is to deteriorate before freezing which eliminates decomposition. Cooling devices available include-

- **Snow.** Food items buried in snow will maintain a temperature of approximately 32° F (0° C).

- **Streams.** Food wrapped in waterproof material and placed in streams will remain cool in summer months. Take care to secure the food to prevent loss.

- **Below ground soil.** Particularly in shady areas or along streams, it remains cooler than the surface. Dig a hole, line with grass, and cover to form an effective cool storage area similar to a root cellar.

- **Water.** When water evaporates, it tends to cool down the surrounding area. Wrap Articles of food in an absorbent material such as cotton or burlap and rewet as the water evaporates.

- **Freezing.** Once food is frozen, it will not decompose. Freeze food in meal-sized portions.

- **Drying.** Drying removes all moisture and preserves the food. Dry all food by sunning, smoking, or burying it in hot sand.

4-40. Many animals and insects will devour an isolated person's food supply if it is not correctly stored. Protect food from insects and birds by wrapping it in material, wrapping and tying brush around the bundle, then wrapping it with another layer of material. This creates "dead air" space making it more difficult for insects and birds to get to the food. If the outer layer is wetted, evaporation will also cool the food to some degree. In most cases, if food is stored several feet off the ground, it will be out of reach of most animals. Hang the food by putting it into a "cache." If the food is dehydrated, the container must be waterproof to prevent reabsorption.

4-41. Frozen food will remain frozen only if the outside temperature remains below freezing. Burying food is a good method of storage as long as scavengers are not in the area to uncover it. Consider insects and small animals when burying food. Food should never be stored in the isolated person's shelter as this may attract wild animals and could be hazardous to the isolated person.

**SUN DRYING**

4-42. To sun dry food, cut it into thin slices so it is less desirable to insects and place it in direct sunlight. Cut meat across the grain and remove all of the fat to improve tenderness and decrease drying time. Add salt to improve taste and accelerate the drying process. Decrease drying time by stringing the meat on a rack so that it dries using the sun and the wind.

**SMOKING**

4-43. Use a non-resinous hard wood such as willow or aspen to produce smoke that will provide slow heat to dry the meat and add flavor. Cut the meat into small, thin slices with all fat removed. Place the meat over a set of heated coals on an improvised rack about two feet above the coals. The goal is to produce heat and smoke-not flame. Place some type of material, such as a poncho or a piece of nylon, around the meat to contain the smoke. Place chips of green wood on the coals to produce the smoke that will preserve the meat. Meat smoked overnight in this manner will last up to a week. Two days of continuous smoking will preserve the meat for up to four weeks. You can consume properly smoked meat; it will look like a dark, curled, brittle stick, without further cooking.

4-44. If the situation allows, the isolated person needs to gather and preserve more plant foods than can be eaten, preserve excess in the same manner as animal foods. Dry plants and fruits by wind, air, sun, or fire, with or without smoke. Any combination of these methods will remove moisture. If the plant part is large, such as tubers, it should be sliced and then dried. Some type of protection may be necessary to prevent consumption or contamination by insects. Carry extra fruits or berries by wrapping them in leaves or moss.

## Plants

4-45. If personnel enter into an isolating event with some basic knowledge and information, they will be able to supplement or totally survive off plant life in the area if it is abundant and available. Plants are valuable sources of food because they are widely available, easily procured and, in the proper combinations, can meet all nutritional needs. Plants provide carbohydrates, which provide the body energy and calories. Carbohydrates keep weight and energy up and include important starches and sugars. Many types of vitamins and minerals can be found in different varieties of plants and can provide the crucial nutrients that the body needs to remain healthy and disease free.

4-46. If the plant includes an inedible or poisonous variety in its family, the edible plant must be distinguishable from the poisonous one to the average eye. Personnel can find valuable information on edible plants in the area of operations by doing a country study or purchasing a plant identification book or set of plant identification cards. There is also plant information on the evasion chart personnel can procure.

4-47. The best and safest method for edibility of a plant is positive identification of the plant. If positive identification is not possible, then use the edibility test. When selecting plant foods, the following should be considered:

- Look for plant parts that contain high energy such as fruit, seeds, grains, nuts, tubers, and bulbs.

- Select plants resembling those cultivated by people.

4-48. It is risky to rely on plants being edible for human consumption simply because animals have also been eating the plants. The animal may be able to digest certain toxins that a person cannot. When selecting an unknown plant as a possible food source, apply the following rules:

- Often plants growing near homes and occupied buildings or along roadsides have been sprayed with pesticides. Wash these plants thoroughly. In more highly developed countries with many automobiles, avoid roadside plants, if possible, due to contamination from exhaust emissions.

- Boil or disinfect plants growing in contaminated water.

- Some plants develop extremely dangerous fungal toxins. To lessen the chance of accidental poisoning, do not eat any fruit starting to spoil or showing signs of mildew or fungus.

- Plants of the same species may differ in their toxic or sub toxic compounds content because of genetic or environmental factors. One example of this is the foliage of the common chokecherry. Some chokecherry plants have high concentrations of deadly cyanide compounds but others have low concentrations or none. Horses have died from eating wilted wild cherry leaves. Avoid any weed, leaves, or seeds with an almond like scent, a characteristic of the cyanide compounds.

- Some people are more susceptible to gastric distress (from plants). If personnel are sensitive in this way, they should avoid unknown wild plants. If they are extremely sensitive to poison ivy, they should avoid products from this family, including any parts from sumacs, mangoes, and cashews.

- Some edible wild plants, such as acorns and water lily rhizomes, are bitter. These bitter substances, usually tannin compounds, make them unpalatable. Boiling them in several changes of water will usually remove these bitter properties.

- Many valuable wild plants have high concentrations of oxalate compounds, also known as oxalic acid. Oxalates produce a sharp burning sensation in the mouth and throat and damage the kidneys. Baking, roasting, or drying usually destroys these oxalate crystals. The corm (bulb) of the jack-in- the-pulpit is also known as the "Indian turnip," but it can be eaten after removing these crystals by slow baking or by drying.

**WARNING**

**Avoid mushrooms and fungi; they are not technically plants. Fungi have toxic peptides, a protein-based poison that has no taste. They are of little nutritional value and it is very difficult to determine if they are poisonous or safe to consume.** 

**There is no field test for determining if an unknown mushroom or fungi is edible except by eating them. There are many poisonous varieties, and some wild mushrooms are hard for experts to identify. The lack of nutrients and the increased risk of accidental poisoning make them a nonviable food source.**

- Avoid plants with umbrella-shaped flowers although carrots, celery, dill, and parsley are members of this family (see figure 4-2 on page 4-9\). One of the most poisonous plants, water hemlock, is also a member of this family.

**Figure 4-2. Umbrella-shaped flowers**

4-49. Avoid all of the following:

- All of the legume family (beans and peas). They absorb minerals from the soil and can cause digestive problems. Selenium is the most common mineral absorbed is which has given locoweed its fame. (Locoweed is a vetch, which is an herbaceous plant of the pea family).

- Plants with a milky sap; this is an indicator of a poisonous plant. Do not eat plants that are irritants to the skin, such as poison ivy.

4-50. Examples of poisonous bulbs include tulips and death camas. Also-

- Avoid white and yellow berries for they are frequently poisonous. About one-half of all red berries are poisonous. Blue or black berries are generally safe for consumption.

- Consider plants with shiny leaves as poisonous.

- The following are generally considered safe to eat:

- Aggregated fruits and berries (for example, thimbleberry, raspberry, salmonberry, and blackberry) are always edible.

- Single fruits on a stem.

**PLANT IDENTIFICATION**

4-51. In addition to memorizing particular varieties through familiarity, plants may be identified by using such factors as-

- Leaf shape and margin.

- Leaf arrangements.

- Root structure.

4-52. The basic leaf margins are toothed, lobed, and toothless or smooth (see figure 4-3 on page 4-10\).

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/21.webp)

**Figure 4-3. Leaf margins**

4-53. Leaves may be lance-shaped, elliptical, egg-shaped, oblong, wedge-shaped, triangular, long- pointed, or top-shaped (see figure 4-4\).

**Figure 4-4. Leaf shapes**

4-54. As shown in figure 4-5 on page 4-11, the basic types of leaf arrangements are opposite, alternate, compound, simple, and basal rosette.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/22.webp)

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/23.webp)

**Figure 4-5. Leaf arrangements**

4-55. The basic types of root structures, shown in figure 4-6 on page 4-12, are the taproot, tuber, bulb, rhizome, clove, corm, and crown. Bulbs (onions), when sliced in half, will show concentric rings. Cloves are those bulblike structures that remind us of garlic and will separate into small pieces when broken apart. This characteristic separates wild onions from wild garlic. Taproots resemble carrots and may be single-rooted or branched, but usually only one plant stalk arises from each root. Examples of tubers are potatoes and daylilies. Isolated persons will find these structures either on strings or in clusters underneath the parent plants. Rhizomes are large, creeping rootstock or underground stems. Many plants arise from the "eyes" of these roots. Corms are similar to bulbs but are solid when cut rather than possessing rings. A crown is the type of root structure found on plants such as asparagus. Crowns look much like a mop head under the soil's surface.

4-56. Learn as much as possible about the unique characteristics of plants used for food. Some plants have both edible and poisonous parts. Many are edible only at certain times of the year. Others may have poisonous relatives that look very similar to the edible varieties of those used for medicinal purposes.

**Figure 4-6. Root structures**

**PLANT EDIBILITY TESTING**

4-57. Select plants that grow in sufficient quantity within the local area to justify the edibility test and provide a lasting source of food if the plant proves edible. Plants growing in water or moist soil are often the most palatable. Plants growing in shaded areas are less bitter. There are exceptions to every rule, but isolated persons should only select unknown plants as a last resort.

4-58. When selecting unknown plants for possible consumption, remember the poisonous characteristics to avoid. Apply the edibility test to only one plant at a time so if some abnormality does occur, it will be obvious which plant caused the problem. Once a plant has been selected to be tested, proceed as follows:

- **Step 1**. If there are any unpleasant odors such as a moldy or musty smell coming from the plant, stop testing and disregard as a possible edible plant option. Also, if the plant gives off an "almond" scent, disregard it as a possible edible plant option.

- **Step 2**. Crush or break part of the plant to determine the color of its sap. If the sap is clear, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 3**. Touch the plant's sap or juice to the inner forearm. If there are no ill effects, such as a rash or burning sensation to the skin, then proceed with the rest of the steps.

- **Step 4**. If a there was not an ill reaction when touching the inner forearm, place some of the plant juice on the outer lip for eight minutes. If a reaction occurs, stop the test.

- **Step 5.** If still no reaction, taste a small pinch of the plant and leave it in the mouth for eight minutes. If there is an unpleasant taste, such as bitterness or a numbing sensation of the tongue or lips, stop the test. If a reaction does not occur, swallow the pinch of plant.

Note. Sometimes heavy smokers are unable to taste various poisons, such as alkaloids.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/26.webp)

- **Step 6.** After swallowing, wait eight hours. If there is no reaction after eight hours, chew a handful of the plant, swallow, and wait an additional eight hours. If no reaction occurs after eight hours, consider the tested plant part edible.

- **Step 7.** Eat any new or strange food with restraint until the body has become accustomed to it. The plant may be slightly toxic and harmful when eaten in large quantities.

**CAUTION**

Test all parts of the plant for edibility, as some plants have both edible and inedible parts. Do not assume that a part that proved edible when cooked is also edible when raw. Test the part raw to ensure edibility before eating raw. The same part or plant may produce varying reactions in different individuals.

4-59. Before testing a plant for edibility, make sure there are enough plants to make the testing worth the time and effort. Each part of a plant (roots, leaves, flowers, and so on) requires more than 24 hours to test. Do not waste time testing a plant that is not relatively abundant in the area.

4-60. Remember that eating large portions of plant food on an empty stomach may cause diarrhea, nausea, or cramps. Two good examples of this are such familiar foods as green apples and wild onions. Even after testing plant food and finding it safe, eat it in moderation.

4-61. Testing for edibility involves considerable time, so it is important to be proficient at identifying edible plants. To avoid potentially poisonous plants, stay away from any wild or unknown plants that have-

- Milky or discolored sap.

- Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods.

- A bitter or soapy taste.

- Spines, fine hairs, or thorns.

- Foliage that resembles dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley.

- An almond scent in woody parts and leaves.

- Grain heads with pink, purplish, or black spurs.

- A three-leafed growth pattern.

4-62. Using the above criteria as eliminators when choosing plants for the universal edibility test will cause isolated persons to avoid some edible plants. More important, these criteria will often help in avoiding plants that are potentially toxic to eat or touch. Personnel should learn as much as possible about the plant life of the areas where they train regularly and where they expect to be operating. The following are ten globally available plants to identify and use. These plants are in almost every biome:

- Cattail.

- Segmented grass.

- Dandelion.

- Aggregate berries.

- Thistle.

- Onions.

- Clover.

## Most common global plants to procure

4-64. **Cattail**. Underground stems (rhizomes) are high in starch and can be gathered year round. They can be eaten raw by chewing the central starchy core after the spongy surrounding tissue is removed. When boiled the entire rhizome can be eaten. Young shoots, green flowers, yellow pollen and the white inner leaves of immature stems in spring and early summer are also provide nutrition to the isolated person.

4-65. **Palms**. Globally there are approximately 2600 species found in temperate, desert, and tropical climates. Palm hearts (the part of the plant or tree form which the leaves branch) are often sweet, containing starch that provide energy. Also, palm fruit including coconuts and dates.

4-66. **Ferns**. There are over 10,000 species globally with only a couple considered mildly toxic. Fiddleheads, the young unrolling fern fronds have the appearance of the end of a violin. You can eat

Fiddleheads raw although they taste better cooked. Rhizomes store starch energy reserves and many ferns can be used to expel stomach and intestinal worms.

4-67. **Bamboo**. Over 1200 species are found globally and is the largest of all grasses. Young shoots (rhizomes) are edible and have the most nutritional value, use leaves and stems as fillers. All other grasses are edible.

**SEAWEED**

4-68. Seaweed is a form of marine algae found on or near ocean shores. There are also some edible freshwater varieties. Seaweed is a valuable source of iodine, other minerals, and vitamin C. Large quantities of seaweed in an unaccustomed stomach can produce a severe laxative effect. The following lists various types of edible seaweed:

- Dulse (rhodymenia palmata).

- Green seaweed (ulva lactuca).

- Irish moss (chondrus crispus).

- Kelp (alaria esculenta).

- Laver (porphyra species).

- Mojaban (sargassum fulvellum).

- Sugar wrack (laminaria saccharina).

4-69. When gathering seaweed for food, find living plants attached to rocks or floating free. Seaweed washed onshore any length of time may be spoiled or decayed. Dry freshly harvested seaweed for later use.

4-70. Different types of seaweed are prepared in different ways. Thin and tender varieties of seaweed are sun dried or over a fire until crisp, then crushed and added to soups or broths. Boil thick, leathery seaweeds for a short time to soften them and eat as a vegetable or with other foods. Some varieties can be consumed raw after testing for edibility.

**PREPARING PLANTS FOR CONSUMPTION**

4-71. Although some plants or plant parts are edible raw, others must be cooked to be edible or palatable. Edible means that a plant or food will provide necessary nutrients to an isolated person. Palatable means that it is pleasing to eat. Many wild plants are edible but barely palatable. It is a good idea to learn to identify, prepare, and eat wild foods.

4-72. Methods used to improve the taste of plant food include soaking, boiling, cooking, or leaching. Leach by crushing the food (for example, acorns), placing it in a strainer, and pouring boiling water through it or immersing it in running water.

4-73. Boil leaves, stems, and buds until tender, changing the water, if necessary, to remove any bitterness.

4-74. Boil, bake, or roast tubers and roots. Drying helps to remove caustic oxalates from some roots like those in the arum family.

4-75. Leach acorns in water, if necessary, to remove the bitterness. Some nuts, such as chestnuts, are good raw, but taste better roasted.

4-76. You can consume many grains and seeds raw until they mature. When they are hard or dry, they may need to be boiled or ground into meal or flour.

4-77. The sap from many trees, such as maples, birches, walnuts, and sycamores, contains sugar. Boil these saps to make syrup for sweetening. It takes about 9 gallons of maple sap to make 1 quart of maple syrup.

**MAMMALS**

4-78. There are 5,360 different species of mammals in the world. Mammals are classified under the following nine main categories:

- Egg laying mammals (spiny anteaters).

- Marsupials (kangaroo).

- Insect-eating (rats).

- Chiropetra (bats).

- Hooved animals (zebras).

- Aquatic mammals (dolphins).

- Carnivora (lions).

- Proboscidea (elephants).

- Primates (humans).

4-79. All mammals are edible. However, the polar bear and the bearded seal have toxic amounts of vitamin A in their livers. Mammals are excellent sources of protein and essential amino acids sufficient for the maintenance of life and the repair of damaged tissue. They are the best tasting food source and closest to the normal American diet. There are some drawbacks to obtaining wild mammals as a food source. For example, in a denied area, the enemy may detect any traps and snares used to catch the animals.

4-80. Take caution, mammals have teeth and will bite in self-defense. The bite from a mammal can cause a severe infection. The amount of injury that a mammal can inflict is in direct proportion to its size. Any mother mammal can be extremely aggressive in defense of her young. Any mammal with no route of escape will fight when cornered. The duck-billed platypus, native to Australia and Tasmania, is an egg-laying, semiaquatic mammal that has poisonous claws on its hind legs. Scavenging mammals, such as the coyote, may carry diseases. Isolated persons must be prepared to hunt, shoot, trap, or snare mammals from their environment.

**HUNTING**

4-81. To become successful in hunting, isolated persons must go through a behavioral change and reorganize personal priorities. This means the one and only goal for the present is to kill an animal for food. To kill this animal, the isolated person must mentally become a predator. They must be willing and prepared to undergo stress to hunt down and kill an animal. Because of the type of field expedient weapons, isolated persons are likely to have, it will be necessary to get very close to the animal to immobilize or kill it. This requires considerable stealth and cunning. Knowledge of the animal is also very important. Observe the animal life of the area by studying signs such as trails, droppings, and bedding areas. Isolated persons should understand the following general characteristics of the animals in the area:

- The size of the tracks gives a good idea of the size of the animal.

- The depth of the tracks indicates the weight of the animal.

- Animal droppings provide much information. For example, if it is still warm or slimy, it was made very recently; if there is a large amount scattered around the area, it could well be a feeding or bedding area. The droppings may also indicate what the animal feeds on. Carnivores often have hair and bone in their droppings. Herbivores have coarse portions of the plants they have eaten in their droppings.

- Many animals mark their territory by urinating or scraping areas on the ground or trees. These signs could indicate good trap or ambush sites.

4-82. By following those signs, (tracks and droppings), study the feeding, watering, and resting areas of the hunted animals. Well-worn trails often lead to the animal's watering place. Having made a careful study of all the animal signs, the isolated person is in a much better position to capture it, whether electing to stalk, trap, snare, or lie in wait to shoot it. Wild animals rely entirely upon their senses for their preservation. These senses are smell, vision, and hearing. Humans have lost the keenness of some of their senses such as smelling and hearing.

4-83. To overcome this loss, humans have the ability to reason. As an example, some animals have a fantastic sense of smell, but by approaching, the quarry from a downwind direction will allow you to circumvent their keen sense of smell. The best times to hunt are at dawn and dusk as animals are either leaving or returning to their bedding areas. Both diurnal and nocturnal animals are active at this time. The following are five basic methods of hunting:

- **Ambush**. Ambush is the best method for inexperienced hunters as it involves less skill. The main principle of this method is to wait along a well-used game trail until the quarry approaches within killing range. Morning and evening are usually the best times to hunt. Take care not to disturb the area; always wait downwind. Patience and self-control are necessary to remain motionless.

- **Stalking**. Stalking refers to the stealthy approach toward game. When an animal has been sighted the isolated person proceeds to close the distance using all available cover. Move slowly in order to minimize noise. Quick movements are easily detected by the animals. Always approach from the downwind side and move when the animal's head is down eating, drinking, or looking in another direction. Blind stalking uses the same techniques as in regular stalking, the main difference being that the isolated person is stalking a position where the animal is expected to be while the animal is not in sight.

- **Tracking**. Tracking is very difficult unless conditions are ideal. This method involves reading all of the signs left behind by the animal, interpreting what the animal is doing, and determining how it can best be killed. The most common signs are trails, beds, urine, droppings, blood, tracks, and feeding signs.

- **Funneling**. Some wild animals can be scared or driven in a direction where other isolated persons or traps have been set. Using this method to funnel the animals into a valley or canyon is a good place to make a drive. More than one person is usually necessary to make a drive.

4-84. Once they have found an animal, isolated persons will need a method of killing the animal. If a firearm is available and firing it will not reveal the isolated person's position to the enemy, shoot the animal from a safe distance with the firearm. Isolated persons cannot afford to waste ammunition on moving game that is beyond the effective range of the firearm. Wait for the animal to pause and then place an accurate shot to a vital area on the animal. Isolated persons should aim for the brain, spine, lungs, or heart. A hit in these areas is usually fatal. Take the best shot at the broad side of the animal; this also gives a larger point of aim. The shot will spoil any meat around the entry and exit wound; aim for a spot that will spoil the least amount of meat.

4-85. Some larger species of mammals have very thick skulls, and bullets may not fully penetrate through the skull plate. Larger animals may not go down right away; therefore, once the shot is taken, isolated persons should be prepared to track the animal. They may have to follow the animal's track or blood trail until they find the animal. Ensure the animal is dead before approaching the animal, as it may attack when wounded. Isolated persons can poke the animal in the eye with a large stick to ensure it is safe to approach. Hunting at night will allow the hunter to get closer to animals. A bright flashlight or an improvised torch can blind the animal. If a firearm is not available, an improvised impact weapon, such as a club or a spear, may be used.

**TRAPPING AND SNARES**

4-86. When an isolated person is unarmed or the sound of a rifle shot could be a problem, trapping and snaring is a good alternative. Several well-placed traps have the potential to catch much more game than one isolated person with a rifle is likely to shoot. Traps and snares also allow isolated persons to hunt while they are completing other tasks necessary for recovery.

4-87. Traps and snares work 24 hours a day without anyone needing to be present. Noise from animals attempting to free themselves from a trap is a consideration on how frequently the trap is checked, as well as its placement. A periotic check of the traps and game retrieval, and/or the traps resets are required for a successful hunt. For any type of trap or snare to be effective, isolated persons must-

- Be familiar with the species of animal they intend to catch.

- Be capable of constructing a proper trap and properly masking their scent.

- Not alarm the prey by leaving signs of human presence.

4-88. Isolated persons must determine what species of game are in the area and set traps specifically for those animals in mind. Look for the following:

- Runs and trails.

- Tracks.

- Droppings.

- Chewed or rubbed vegetation.

- Nesting or rooting sites.

- Feeding and watering areas.

4-89. Position traps and snares where there is proof that animals pass through; distinguish between a "run" and a "trail." A trail will show signs of use by several species and will be rather distinct. A run is usually smaller and less distinct and will only contain signs of one species. Isolated persons may construct a perfect snare, but it will not catch anything if haphazardly placed in the woods. Animals have bedding areas, water holes, and feeding areas with trails leading from one to another; place snares and traps around these areas to be effective. In a denied area, trap and snare concealment is important. However, it is equally important not to create a disturbance that will alarm the animal and cause it to avoid the trap.

4-90. If isolated persons must dig, move all fresh dirt away from the area. Most animals will instinctively avoid a pitfall-type trap. Prepare the various parts of a trap or snare away from the site, carry them in, and set them up. Such actions make it easier to avoid disturbing the local vegetation, thereby alerting the prey. Do not use freshly cut, live vegetation to construct a trap or snare. Freshly cut vegetation "bleeds sap" that emits an odor smelled by the prey. It is an alarm signal to the animal.

4-91. Remove or mask the human scent on and around set traps. Although birds do not have a developed sense of smell, nearly all mammals depend on smell even more than on sight. Even the slightest human scent on a trap alarms the prey and causes it to avoid the area. Actually removing the scent from a trap is difficult, but masking it is relatively easy. Use the fluid from the gall and urine bladders of previous kills. Do not use human urine. Mud, particularly from an area with plenty of rotting vegetation, is also effective. Use it to coat hands when handling the trap and to coat the trap when setting it.

4-92. In nearly all parts of the world, animals know the smell of burned vegetation and smoke. It is only when a fire is actually burning that they become alarmed. Therefore, smoking the trap parts is an effective means to mask human scent. If one of the above techniques is not practical, and if time permits, allow a trap to weather for a few days and then set it. Do not handle a trap while it is weathering. When positioning the trap, camouflage it as naturally as possible to prevent detection by the enemy and to avoid alarming the prey.

4-93. Traps or snares placed on a trail or run should use funneling or channelization. To build a channel, construct a funnel-shaped barrier extending from the sides of the trail toward the trap, with the narrowest part nearest the trap. Attempt to stay off the trail or run and construct funneling from the sides in order to limit the amount of scent on the trap or snare site. Channelization should be inconspicuous to avoid alerting the prey. As the animal gets to the trap, it cannot turn left or right and continues into the trap. Few wild animals will back up, preferring to face the direction of travel. Channelization does not have to be an impassable barrier; it only has to be inconvenient for the animal to go over or through the barrier. For best effect, the channelization should reduce the trail's width to just slightly wider than the targeted animal's body. Maintain this constriction at least as far back from the trap as the animal's body length, and then begin widening toward the mouth of the funnel.

**Use of Bait**

4-94. Baiting a trap or snare increases the chances of catching an animal. When catching fish, isolated persons must bait nearly all the devices. Success with a non-baited trap depends on its placement in a good location. A baited trap can draw animals in. The bait should be something the animal knows. However, this bait should not be so readily available in the immediate area that the animal can get it close by. For example, baiting a trap with corn in the middle of a cornfield would not likely work. Likewise, if corn is not grown in the region, a corn-baited trap may arouse an animal's curiosity and keep it alerted while it ponders the strange food. Under such circumstances, it may not go for the bait.

4-95. An example of bait that works well on small mammals is the peanut butter from a meal, ready-to-eat ration. Salt is also good bait. When using such bait, scatter bits of it around the trap to give the prey a chance to sample it and develop a craving for it. The animal will then overcome some of its caution before it gets to the trap. If the trap is set and baited for one species but another species takes the bait without being caught, try to determine what the animal was. Then set a proper trap for that animal, using the same bait. Scavenger- type animals may be attracted to remains of previous kills or leftover entrails; these are excellent bait for fishing.

**Construction of Traps and Snares**

4-96. Traps and snares crush, choke, hang, or entangle the prey. A single trap or snare will commonly incorporate two or more of these principles. The mechanisms that provide power to the trap are usually very simple. The struggling victim, the force of gravity or a bent sapling's tension provides the power. The heart of any trap or snare is the trigger. When planning a trap or snare, consider how it should affect the prey, what is the source of power, and what will be the most efficient trigger. The answers will help in devising a specific trap for a specific species. Traps are designed to catch and hold or to catch and kill. Snares are traps that incorporate a noose to accomplish either function.

**Triggers for Traps and Snares**

4-97. Traps and snares crush, choke, hang, or entangle the prey. A single trap or snare will commonly incorporate two or more of these principles. The mechanisms that provide power to the trap are usually very simple. The struggling victim, the force of gravity or a bent sapling's tension provides the power.

4-98. The heart of any trap or snare is the trigger. When planning a trap or snare, ask yourself how it should affect the prey, what is the source of power, and what will be the most efficient trigger. Your answers will help you devise a specific trap for a specific species. Traps are designed to catch and hold or to catch and kill. Snares are traps that incorporate a noose to accomplish either function. Triggers for trapping mechanisms should be made out of dead seasoned wood that is solid in composition. Avoid green or rotted wood, which may fail, bend or break at a crucial point once the mechanism is set.

4-99. Triggers can be classified as contact triggers that are tripped by the game walks into the trap or snare brushing the trigger tripping the mechanism. Baited triggers put an attractant like meat, or ration peanut butter, or other sweet or aromatic food material that will draw the game into the trap to activate the trigger system. A simple trigger can be made from the natural Y's of tree branches that create a natural hook that will hold another Y branch in place with friction that can contain the power of the mechanism until the game moves tripping the trigger releasing the of the mechanism activating the trap or snare. Simple triggers can also be made by carving wood to create notches in two pieces of wood that will create two hooks that interconnect the same as the Y's in the tree branches.

4-100. Triggers can be created utilizing a toggle that is set and held in place and set with creating a leverage point that when the game passes through in either direction the trigger will be tripped. An example of this type of trigger is the H bi-directional trigger system. The H bi-directional trigger is made by driving two stakes in the ground with enough space for the game to pass through. Cut a notch at the top end of the two stakes- they should be cut on opposing sides of the stakes. Place a toggle that has notches that match up to the stakes. Secure a power source like a spring pole and a slip loop to the toggle. The isolated person can also make a trip line to activate a box style trap with improvised cordage. A prop stick holding up a box style trap tied to a trip line is simple and effective when the game hits the trip line in any direction the box will fall trapping the game.

4-101. Leave the bark on the trigger materials used. Camouflage all exposed areas without bark that show white wood with mud. Construct carefully, check that the parts of the trigger fit, and release effectively. The components of the trigger system can be smoked over a smudge fire to de-scent them before being put in place. The scent of burnt wood will generally alarm the game.

4-102. The following are common types of snares that might be devised:

- **Simple loop snare**. A simple snare consists of a noose placed over a trail or den hole and attached to a firmly planted stake. If the noose is some type of cordage placed upright on a game trail, use small twigs or blades of grass to hold it up. Filaments from spider webs are excellent for holding nooses open. Make sure the noose is large enough to pass freely over the animal's head. As the animal continues to move, the noose tightens around its neck. The more the animal struggles, the tighter the noose gets. This type of snare usually does not kill the animal. Cordage may loosen enough to slip off the animal's neck; therefore, wire is the best choice for a simple snare (see figure 4-7 on page 4-20\).

**Figure 4-7. Simple loop snare**

- **Apache foot snare**. The apache foot snare is an example of a hold- type trap. It is used for large browsers and grazers like deer (see figure 4-8\). This snare should be located along game trails, where an obstruction, such as a log, blocks the trail. When animals jump over this obstruction, a very shallow depression is formed where their hooves land. The Apache foot snare should be placed at this depression.

**Figure 4-8. Apache foot snare**

- **Drag noose snare**. Use a drag noose on an animal run. Place forked sticks on either side of the run and lay a sturdy cross member across them. Tie the noose to the cross member and hang it at a height above the animal's head. (Nooses designed to catch by the head should never be low enough for the prey to step into with a foot.) As the noose tightens around the animal's neck, the animal pulls the cross member from the forked sticks and drags it along. The surrounding vegetation quickly catches the cross member, and the animal becomes entangled (see figure 4-9 on page 4-21\).

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/28.webp)

**Figure 4-9. Drag noose snare**

- **Twitch-up snare**. A twitch-up is a supple sapling that, when bent over and secured with a triggering device, will provide power to a variety of snares. Select a hickory or other hardwood sapling along the trail. A twitch-up will work much faster and with more force if all branches and foliage are removed. A simple twitch-up snare uses two forked sticks, each with a long and a short leg. Bend the twitch-up and mark the trail below it. Drive the long leg of one forked stick firmly into the ground at that point. Ensure that the cut on the short leg of this stick is parallel to the ground. Tie the long leg of the remaining forked stick to a piece of cordage secured to the twitch- up. Cut the short leg so that it catches on the short leg of the other forked stick. Extend a noose over the trail. Set the trap by bending the twitch-up and engaging the short legs of the forked sticks. When an animal catches its head in the noose, it pulls the forked sticks apart, allowing the twitch- up to spring up and hang the prey (see figure 4-10 on page 4-22\).

Note. Do not use green sticks for the trigger. The sap that oozes out could glue the moving parts together.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/29.webp)

**Figure 4-10. Twitch-up snare**

- **Squirrel pole noose**. A squirrel pole is a long pole placed against a tree in an area showing a lot of squirrel activity (see figure 4-11 on page 4-23\). Place several wire nooses along the top and sides of the pole so that a squirrel trying to go up or down the pole will have to pass through one or more of them. Position the nooses (2 to 2 1/4 inches in diameter) about 1 inch off the pole. Place the top and bottom wire nooses 18 inches from the top and bottom of the pole to prevent the squirrel from getting its feet on a solid surface and chewing through the wire. Squirrels are naturally curious. After an initial period of caution, they will try to go up or down the pole and will be caught in the noose. The struggling animal will soon fall from the pole and strangle. Other squirrels will be drawn to the commotion. In this way, several squirrels can be caught. Multiple poles can be placed to increase the catch.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/30.webp)

**Figure 4-11. Squirrel pole noose**

- **Noosing wand**. A noose stick or "noosing wand" is useful for capturing roosting birds or small mammals. It requires a patient operator. This wand is more a weapon than a trap. It consists of a pole (as long as the isolated person can effectively handle) with a slip noose of wire or stiff cordage at the small end. To catch an animal, the noose is slipped over the neck of a roosting bird and pulled tight. It can also be placed over a den hole as the isolated person hides in a nearby blind. When the animal emerges from the den, the isolated person jerks the pole to tighten the noose and thus captures the animal. A stout club may be needed to kill the prey (see figure 4-12\).

**Figure 4-12. Noosing wand**

- **Treadle spring snare**. Use a treadle snare against small game on a trail. Dig a shallow hole in the trail. Then drive a forked stick (fork down) into the ground on each side of the hole on the same side of the trail. Select two straight sticks that span the two forks. Position these two sticks so that their ends engage the forks. Place several sticks over the hole in the trail by positioning one end over the lower horizontal stick and the other on the ground on the other side of the hole. Cover the hole with enough sticks so that the prey must step on at least one of them to set off the snare. Tie one end of a piece of cordage to a twitch-up or to a weight suspended over a tree limb. Bend the twitch-up or raise the suspended weight to determine where to tie the trigger. The trigger should be about 2 inches long. Form a noose with the other end of the cordage. Route and spread the noose over the top of the sticks over the hole. Place the trigger stick against the horizontal sticks and route the cordage behind the sticks so that the tension of the power source will hold it in place. Adjust the bottom horizontal stick so that it will barely hold against the trigger. As the animal

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/31.webp)

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/32.webp)

places its foot on a stick across the hole, the bottom horizontal stick moves down, releasing the trigger and allowing the noose to catch the animal by the foot. Because of the disturbance on the trail, an animal will be wary; therefore, channelization should be used. To increase the effectiveness of this trap, a small bait well may be dug into the bottom of the hole with bait placed in it to lure animals to the snare (see figure 4-13\).

**Figure 4-13. Treadle spring snare**

4-103. The deadfall is a trigger used to drop a weight onto a prey and crush it. The type of weight used may vary, but it should be heavy enough to kill or incapacitate the prey immediately. Construct the deadfall using three notched sticks. These notches hold the sticks together in a figure 4 pattern when under tension. Practice making this trigger beforehand; construction requires close tolerances and precise angles (see figure 4-14 on page 4-25\).

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/33.webp)

**Figure 4-14. Deadfall.** 

4-104. **Paiute deadfall**, The Paiute deadfall is similar to the figure 4-14 deadfall, but uses a piece of cordage and a catch stick. It has the advantage of being easier to set than the figure 4-14. Tie one end of a piece of cordage to the lower end of the diagonal stick. Tie the other end of the cordage to another stick about 2 inches long. This stick is the catch stick. Bring the cord halfway around the vertical stick with the catch stick at a 90-degree angle. Place the bait stick with one end against the drop weight, or a peg driven into the ground, and the other end against the catch stick. When a prey disturbs the bait stick, it falls free, releasing the catch stick. As the diagonal stick flies up, the weight falls, crushing the prey. To increase the effectiveness of this trap, a small bait well may be dug into the bottom of the hole with bait placed in it to lure animals to the snare (see figure 4-15 on page 4-26\).

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/34.webp)

**Figure 4-15. Paiute deadfall**

4-105. **Bow trap**. A bow trap is one of the deadliest traps. It is dangerous to man as well as animals. To construct this trap, build a bow and anchor it to the ground with pegs. Adjust the aiming point as the bow is anchored. Lash a toggle stick to the trigger stick. Two upright sticks driven into the ground hold the trigger stick in place at a point where the toggle stick engages the pulled bowstring. Place a catch stick between the toggle stick and a stake driven into the ground. Tie a tripwire or cordage to the catch stick and route it around stakes and across the game trail where it is tied off. When the prey trips the tripwire, the bow lodges an arrow into it. A notch in the bow serves to help aim the arrow (see figure 4-16 on page 4-27\).

Note. Use caution-this is a lethal trap and should only be approached from the rear of the trap.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/35.webp)

**Figure 4-16. Bow trap**

4-106. **Pig spear shaft**. To construct a pig spear shaft, select a stout pole about eight feet long. At the smaller end, firmly lash several small stakes. Lash the large end tightly to a tree along the game trail. Tie a length of cordage to another tree across the trail. Tie a sturdy, smooth stick to the other end of the cord. From the first tree, tie a tripwire or cord low to the ground, stretch it across the trail, and tie it to a catch stick. Make a slip ring from vines or other suitable material. Encircle the tripwire and the smooth stick with the slip ring. Emplace one end of another smooth stick within the slip ring and its other end against the second tree. Pull the smaller end of the spear shaft across the trail and position it between the short cord and the smooth stick.

4-107. As the animal trips the tripwire, the catch stick pulls the slip ring off the smooth sticks, releasing the spear shaft that springs across the trail and impales the prey against the tree. (see figure 4-17 on page 4-28\)

Note. Use caution-this is a lethal trap and should only be approached from the rear of the trap.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/36.webp)

**Figure 4-17. Pig spear shaft**

4-108. **Bottle trap**. A bottle trap is a simple trap for mice and moles. Dig a hole 12 to 18 inches deep that is wider at the bottom than at the top. Make the top of the hole as small as possible. Place a piece of bark or wood over the hole with small stones under it to hold it up 1 to 2 inches off the ground. Mice or moles will hide under the cover to escape danger and fall into the hole. They cannot climb out because of the wall's backward slope (see figure 4-18\).

Note. Use caution when checking this trap-it is an excellent hiding place for snakes.

## Killing devices

4-109. The rabbit stick, the spear, the bow and arrow, and the sling are several types of killing devices constructed to capture small game to aid in survival.

**CLUB**

4-110. One of the simplest and most effective killing devices is a stout stick as long as an arm, from fingertip to shoulder, called a "rabbit stick." Thrown overhand or sidearm and with considerable force, it is best thrown so that it flies sideways, increasing the chance of hitting the target. It is very effective against small game that stops and freezes as a defense.

**SPEAR**

4-111. Improvise a spear by sharpening the end of a long pole. The spear will be useful to kill small game and to fish. Jab with the spear-do not throw it.

**SLING**

4-112. A sling can be made by tying two pieces of cordage, each about 24 inches long, at opposite ends of a palm-sized piece of leather or cloth. Place a rock in the cloth, wrap one cord around the middle finger, and hold it in the palm. Hold the other cord between the forefingers and thumb. To throw the rock, spin the sling several times in a circle and release the cord between the thumb and forefinger. The sling is very effective against small game, but proficiency with the sling requires practice.

## Butchering mammals

4-113. Once the animal is skinned, break it down into usable-size pieces. This will allow more options for transporting, cooking, and preserving. Butchering involves removing the muscle tissue from the skeletal structure of the animal. Trim off the connective tissue, trim off the fat (save for consumption), and cut the flesh into smaller pieces similar to what would be seen in a butcher shop. The meat can be cut into steaks, roasts, stew meat cubes, and thin slices for drying and smoking.

**SKINNING MAMMALS**

4-114. Once a mammal has been procured, it will need to be skinned. There are two general ways to skin a mammal-the big game method and the glove skinning method.

**Big Game**

4-115. When the mammal is a large animal, the big game skinning method should be used. The first step in skinning is to turn the animal on its back and, with a sharp knife, cut through the skin on a straight line from the tail bone to a point under its neck as illustrated in figure 4-19 on page 4-30. In making this cut, pass around the anus and, with great care, press the skin open until the first two fingers can be inserted between the skin and the thin membrane enclosing the entrails. When the fingers can be forced forward, place the blade of the knife between the fingers, blade up, with the knife held firmly. While forcing the fingers forward, palm upward, follow with the knife blade, cutting the skin but not cutting the membrane.

4-116. If the animal is a male, cut the skin parallel to, but not touching, the penis. If the tube leading from the bladder is accidentally cut, a messy job and unclean meat will result. If the gall or urine bladders are broken, washing will help clean the meat. Otherwise, it is best not to wash the meat but to allow it to form a protective glaze. On reaching the ribs, it is no longer possible to force the fingers forward, because the skin adheres more strongly to flesh and bone. Furthermore, care is no longer necessary. The cut to point C (in figure 4-19 on page 4-30\) can be quickly completed by alternately forcing the knife under the skin and lifting it.

4-117. With the central cut completed, make side cuts consisting of incisions through the skin, running from the central cut up the inside of each leg to the knee and hock joints. Make cuts around the front legs just

above the knees and around the hind legs above the hocks. Make the final cross cut at point C (in figure 4- 19\), and then cut completely around the neck and in back of the ears. Once the cuts are complete, the skinning process can begin. After skinning down the animal's side as far as possible, roll the carcass on its side to skin the back. Then spread out the loose skin to prevent the meat from touching the ground and turn the animal on the skinned side. Follow the same procedure on the opposite side until the skin is free. In opening the membrane which encloses the entrails, follow the same procedure used in cutting the skin by using the fingers of one hand as a guard for the knife and separating the intestines from the membrane. This thin membrane along the ribs and sides can be cut away for a better view. 

4-118. Be careful to avoid cutting the intestines or bladder. The large intestine passes through an aperture in the pelvis. Using a knife, separate this tube from the bone surrounding it. Tie a knot in the bladder tube to prevent the escape of urine. With these steps complete, the entrails can be easily disengaged from the back and removed from the carcass. After gutting is completed, it may be advisable to hang the animal.

**Figure 4-19. Deer skinning example**

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/39.webp)

Note. If the animal is hot, gut the animal before skinning it.

4-119. The intestines of a well-conditioned animal are covered with a lace-like layer of fat which can be lifted off and placed on nearby bushes to dry for later use. The gall bladder which is attached to the liver of some animals should be carefully removed. If it ruptures, the bile will taint anything it touches. Clean the knife if necessary. The kidneys are imbedded in the back, forward of the pelvis, and are covered with fat. Running forward from the kidneys on each side of the backbone are two long strips of chop meat or muscle called tenderloin and/or back strap. Eat this after the liver, heart, and kidneys as it is usually very tender. Edible meat can also be removed from the head, brisket, ribs, backbone, and pelvis.

4-120. Large animals should be quartered. To do this, cut down between the first and second rib and then sever the backbone with an axe or machete. Cut through the brisket of the front half and then chop lengthwise through the backbone to produce the front quarters. On the rear half, cut through the pelvic bone and lengthwise through the backbone. To make the load lighter and easier to transport, the bones can be removed with a knife. Butchering is the final step and is simplified for survival purposes. The main purpose is to cut the meat in manageable-sized portions.

**Small-Game**

4-121. Glove skinning is performed on small game. The initial cuts are made down the insides of the back legs. The skin is then peeled back so that the hindquarters are bare and the tail is severed. To remove the remaining skin, pull it down over the body in much the same manner a pullover sweater is removed. Sever the head and front feet to remove the skin from the body. To remove the internal organs, make a cut into the abdominal cavity without puncturing the organs. This cut must run from the anus to the neck. There are muscles that connect the internal organs to the trunk, and they must be severed to allow the viscera to be removed.

4-122. If the isolated person does not have a knife and only access to rudimentary tools like a sharp rock or dull piece of metal, there is a method of skinning sometimes referred to as the pants and shirt method of skinning. This method is simple and works very well on small to medium size game. The isolated person will separate the skin around the midline of the animal by making an incision around the animal with a cutting implement or by tearing it with their hands. The isolated person will then pull the top and bottom pieces of skin in the opposite direction until they are fully removed from the carcass. This method is very fast and can be completed from a concealed position when needed.

**BIRDS**

4-123. Birds provide a concentrated form of protein and amino acids. Isolated persons eating birds will benefit by their bodies being able to get energy and repair itself from the protein. As with all wild animals, understanding the birds' habits will offer a better chance of catching them. Some species of bird can be captured from their roost at night by hand. During the nesting season, some species will not leave the nest even when approached.

4-124. Birds tend to have regular flyways going from the roost to a feeding area, to water, and so forth. Careful observation should reveal where these flyways are and indicate good areas for catching birds in nets stretched across the flyways. A small gill net on a wooden frame with a disjointed stick for a trigger can also be used. Birds can be caught on baited fishhooks or with simple loop snares. Roosting sites and waterholes are some of the most promising areas for trapping and snaring. See figure 4-20 on page 4-32.

**Figure 4-20. Mist net bird snare**

4-125. An Ojibwa bird pole is a snare that has been used by Native Americans for centuries. To be effective, it should be placed in a relatively open area away from tall trees. For best results, pick a spot near feeding areas, dusting areas, or watering holes. Cut a pole 6 to 7 feet long and trim away all limbs and foliage.

4-126. Do not use resinous wood such as pine. Sharpen the upper end to a point, and then drill a small- diameter hole 2 to 3 inches down from the top. Cut a small stick 4 to 6 inches long and shape one end so that it will almost fit into the hole. This is the perch. Plant the long pole in the ground with the pointed end up. Tie a small weight, about equal to the weight of the targeted species, to a length of cordage. Pass the free end of the cordage through the hole and tie a slip noose that covers the perch. Tie a single overhand knot in the cordage and place the perch against the hole. Allow the cordage to slip through the hole until the overhand knot rests against the pole and the top of the perch. The knot must be smaller than the hole, enabling the knot to slip through the hole.

4-127. The tension of the overhand knot against the pole and perch will hold the perch in position. Spread the noose over the perch, ensuring that it covers the perch and drapes over on both sides. Most birds prefer to rest on something above ground and will land on the perch. As soon as the bird lands, the perch will fall, releasing the overhand knot and allowing the weight to drop. The noose will tighten around the bird's feet, capturing it. If the weight is too heavy, it will cut off the bird's feet, allowing it to escape. Another variation would be to use spring tension such as a tree branch in place of the weight (see figure 4-21 on page 33\).

4-128. Butchering birds is done by first plucking the bird to remove its feathers. The bird can be placed in a container of boiling water to loosen the feathers and make it easier to pluck. The bird can also be skinned to remove the feathers, but skinning removes some of the bird's nutritional value. After plucking or skinning the bird, open up the body cavity and remove the entrails, saving the heart and liver. Most of the usable meat from a bird comes from the breast.

4-129. For larger birds, the legs and thighs can produce a fair amount of meat. Next, cut off the feet. With a knife or improvised tool, cut in between the joints of the bird to separate the skeletal structure. Because of the fragility of a bird's muscle and skeletal structure, most of it can be processed with just the hands and no tools.

4-130. Isolated persons should make sure to wash their hands and any tools after working with raw bird meat to avoid the transfer of bacteria. It is best to leave the meat on the bone for preparation. Most birds except sea birds should be cooked with their skin left on. Sea birds will have improved taste if the oily skin

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/40.webp)

is removed before cooking. Carrion eating birds, such as vultures, must be boiled for at least 20 minutes to kill parasites before further cooking and eating. Cooking techniques are the same as with other game animals. 

4-131. Bird meat can be boiled, baked, roasted, and fried. Bird meat should be fully cooked to eliminate any chance of contracting food-borne illnesses. Preservation methods are the same as other meat. If in or near the ocean, the meat can be placed in a saltwater bath to preserve it. Wash the salt off the meat before cooking.

**Figure 4-21. Ojibwa bird pole**

**INSECTS**

4-132. The most abundant and easily caught life forms on earth are insects. Many insects provide 65 to 80 percent protein compared to only 20 percent for beef. This makes insects an important source of nutrition for the isolated person. The problem with insects is that they have to be gathered in large numbers to get the same amount of protein as you would from a rabbit or other piece of meat. The praying mantis for example, contains 58 percent protein, 12 percent fat, 3 percent ash, vitamin B complex, and vitamin A. The insect's outer skeleton contains a compound of sugars and amino acids.

4-133. Insects to avoid include all adults that bite or sting and hairy or brightly colored insects. Hairy caterpillars and insects that have a pungent odor should also be avoided as well as spiders and common disease carriers such as ticks, flies, and mosquitoes.

4-134. Ants such as the white ant, the carpenter ant, and the honey ant are edible and were a staple in many native cultures. Termites, bee larvae, locusts, dragonflies, bumblebees, cockroaches, locust grasshoppers, golden June beetles, crickets, wasp larvae, and silkworm's larvae are all used for food. Flying insects can be attracted to a light source. If the isolated person places a piece of material in front of the light source with a vessel of water below it, the flying insects will fly into the material and some will fall into the water, remaining for collection and consumption.

4-135. Rotting logs lying on the ground are excellent places to look for a variety of insects including ants, termites, beetles, and grubs. Also, do not overlook nests on or in the ground. Grassy areas, such as fields, are good areas to search because the insects are easily seen. Stones, boards, or other materials lying on the ground provide insects with good nesting sites. Worms are an excellent protein source. They can be found in humus soil and in the root ball of grass clumps, or watch for them after rain on the ground's surface. To prepare worms for eating, place them in a bath of clear potable water. In 15 minutes, the worms will purge themselves and wash themselves out, after which they can be eaten raw.

4-136. Preparation of insects involves removing any stinging apparatus from the insect before consuming. Also, remove their legs, wings, and heads before eating them. Insects with hard outer shells will have parasites and should be fully cooked before consumption. Insects can be cooked using all available cooking methods. Many insects can be preserved for long periods by keeping them alive. Other forms of food preservation are appropriate as well.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/41.webp)

4-137. Insects can be cooked by roasting, baking, frying, and boiling. They can be added to other foods such as plants and other meat, making a stew. This will provide needed protein while avoiding any potential aversion to eating insects. Earthworms are high in protein and should be prepared as follows: soak them in water for a day, squeeze all of the guts to eliminate waste products, and clean them. Then cook them by roasting, baking, frying, or boiling.

**REPTILES**

4-138. Reptiles are a good protein source and relatively easy to catch. Reptiles can be found moving across open ground. They can be procured using a long, forked stick. Place the stick behind the reptile's head to immobilize its ability to strike and inject the isolated person with venom. Isolated persons should then cut off the head about one to two inches from the end to prevent accidental envenomation from the venom sacs left in the snake's head. Snakes have been known to retain a bite reflex for up to 24 hours after the head is removed. Bury the head to prevent it from accidentally being stepped on at a later time. Cut up the belly of the snake and remove the innards. Peel the skin back and pull the skin in one hand and the body of the snake in the other until the skin is removed (see figure 4-22\). Traps with bait may also prove useful in gathering reptiles.

**Figure 4-22. Cleaning a snake**

4-139. Thorough cooking and hand washing is imperative with reptiles. All reptiles are considered carriers of salmonella, which exists naturally on their skin. Turtles and snakes are especially known to infect man. Salmonella can be deadly to an isolated person in an undernourished state and with a weak immune system. Cook food thoroughly and be especially fastidious in washing hands after handling any reptile.

4-140. Lizards are plentiful in most parts of the world. They have dry, scaly skin and five toes on each foot. The only venomous ones are the Gila monster and the Mexican bearded lizard. Care must be taken when handling and preparing the iguana and the monitor lizard, as they commonly harbor the salmonella bacteria in their mouth and teeth. The tail meat is the best tasting and easiest to prepare.

4-141. Turtles are a very good source of meat. There are actually seven different flavors of meat in each snapping turtle. Most turtle meat comes from the front and rear shoulder area, although a large turtle may have some on its neck. The box turtle is a commonly encountered turtle that should not be eaten. It feeds on poisonous mushrooms and may build up a highly toxic poison in its flesh. Cooking does not destroy this

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/42.webp)

toxin. Also avoid the hawksbill turtle found in the Atlantic Ocean, because of its poisonous thorax gland (see figure 4-23\).

**Figure 4-23. Turtles with poisonous flesh**

4-142. Cook reptiles in the same manner as other small game using all cooking methods available. Isolated persons should concentrate on eating the fleshy parts of the reptile. For example, a turtle has meat near its legs and where the body meets the fins, neck, and tail. These areas can be fried or cooked in a stew. All meat should be thoroughly cooked. Reptile eggs can also be eaten. Reptiles can be kept alive to preserve them or use other methods of preservation previously discussed to keep them fresh for consumption.

**AMPHIBIANS**

4-143. Frogs are easily found around bodies of fresh water. Frogs seldom move from the safety of the water's edge. At the first sign of danger, they plunge into the water and bury themselves in the mud and debris. Frogs are characterized by smooth, moist skin. There are few poisonous species of frogs. Avoid any brightly colored frog or one that has a distinct "X" mark on its back as well as all tree frogs. Do not confuse toads with frogs. Toads may be recognized by their dry, "warty" or bumpy skin. They are usually found on land in drier environments.

4-144. Several species of toads secrete a poisonous substance through their skin as a defense against attack. Therefore, to avoid poisoning, do not handle or eat toads. Do not eat salamanders; only about 25 percent of all salamanders are edible, so it is not worth the risk of possibly selecting a poisonous variety. Salamanders are found around the water. They are characterized by smooth, moist skin and have only four toes on each foot. Amphibians provide a good source of protein.

4-145. A frog gig, which is a long spear with several tines resembling a pitchfork on the end, can be used to spear an amphibian at the water's edge. Most of the meat content from frogs will come from their legs. Amphibians should be cooked like any other small game; roasting on a stick works well. The meat should be thoroughly cooked. Preservation of amphibians as food is the same as stated for other meat (see figure 4-24, page 4-36\).

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/43.webp)

**Figure 4-24. Amphibians**

**FISH**

4-146. Fish represent a good source of protein and fat. They offer some distinct advantage in that they are usually more abundant than mammal wildlife, and the methods to procure them are mostly silent. To be successful at catching fish, their habits must be known. For instance, fish tend to feed heavily before a storm. Fish are not likely to feed after a storm when the water is muddy and swollen. Light often attracts fish at night.

4-147. When there is a heavy current fish rest in places where there is an eddy, such as near rocks. Fish also gather where there are deep pools, under overhanging brush, and in and around submerged foliage, logs, or other objects that offer them shelter. There are no poisonous freshwater fish. However, the catfish species has sharp, needlelike protrusions on its dorsal fins and barbels. These can inflict painful puncture wounds that quickly become infected.

4-148. Cook all freshwater fish to kill parasites. As a precaution, also cook saltwater fish caught within a reef or within the influence of a freshwater source. Any marine life obtained farther out in the sea will not contain parasites because of the saltwater environment. These may be safely eaten raw.

4-149. Most fish encountered are edible. However, the organs of some species are always poisonous to man; other fish can become toxic because of elements in their diets. Ciguatera is a form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of subtropical and tropical marine fish, which have accumulated naturally occurring toxins through their diet. These toxins build up in the fish's tissues. The toxins are known to originate from several algae species that are common to ciguatera-endemic regions in the lower latitudes. Cooking does not eliminate the toxins; neither does drying, smoking, or marinating.

4-150. Marine fish most commonly implicated in ciguatera poisoning include barracudas, jacks, mackerel, triggerfish, snappers, and groupers. Many other species of warm water fishes harbor ciguatera toxins. The occurrence of toxic fish is sporadic and not all fish of a given species or from a given locality will be toxic. Other examples of poisonous saltwater fish are the porcupine fish, the cowfish, the thorn fish, the oil fish, and the puffer fish (see figure 4-25 on page 4-37\).

**Figure 4-25. Fish with poisonous flesh**

**FISHING DEVICES**

4-151. Isolated persons can make fishhooks, nets, and traps. Field-expedient fishhooks can be made from pins, needles, wire, small nails, or any piece of metal (see figure 4-26\). Wood, bones, coconut shells, thorns, flint, seashells, tortoise shells, or a combination of these items can also be used.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/45.webp)

**Figure 4-26. Improvised fish hooks**

**Wooden Hook**

4-152. To make a wooden hook, cut a piece of hardwood about 1 inch long and about 1/4 inch in diameter to form the shank. Cut a notch in one end in which to place the point. Place the point (a piece of bone, wire, or nail) in the notch. Hold the point in the notch and tie it securely so that it does not move out of position. This is a large hook; to make smaller hooks, use smaller material.

**Gorge or Skewer**

4-153. A gorge or skewer is a small shaft of wood, bone, metal, or other material. It is sharp on both ends and notched in the middle where cordage is tied. Bait the gorge by placing a piece of bait on it lengthwise. When the fish swallows the bait, it also swallows the gorge. If isolated persons are tending the fishing line when the fish bites, they should not attempt to pull on the line to set the hook as they would with a conventional hook. Allow the fish to swallow the bait to get the gorge as far down its throat as possible before the gorge sets itself.

**Stakeout**

4-154. A stakeout is a fishing device that can be used in a non-permissive environment. To construct a stakeout, drive two supple saplings into the bottom of the lake, pond, or stream with their tops just below the water's surface. Tie a cord between them just slightly below the surface. Tie two short cords with hooks or gorges to this cord, ensuring that they cannot wrap around the poles or each other. They should also not slip along the long cord. Bait the hooks or gorges (see figure 4-27\).

**Figure 4-27. Stakeout**

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/46.webp)

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/47.webp)

**Gill Net**

4-155. If a gill net is not available, isolated persons can make one using parachute suspension line or similar material (see figure 4-28 on page 4-39\). Remove the core lines from the suspension line and tie the casing between two trees. Attach several core lines to the casing by doubling them over and tying them with Prusik knots or girth hitches. These lines should be six times the desired depth of the net (for example, a 6-foot piece of string girth-hitched over the casing will yield two 3-foot pieces, which after completing the net, will provide a 1-foot deep net).

4-156. The length of the desired net and the size of the mesh determine the number of core lines used and the space between them. The recommended size of the spaces in the net mesh is about 1 inch square. Starting at one end of the casing, tie the second and the third core lines together using an overhand knot. Then tie the fourth and fifth, sixth and seventh, and so on, until the last core line is reached. All core lines should now be tied in pairs with a single core line hanging at each end. Start the second row with the first core line, tie it to the second, the third to the fourth, and so on.

**Figure 4-28. Making a gill net**

4-157. To keep the rows even and to regulate the size of the mesh, tie a guideline to the trees. Isolated persons should position the guideline on the opposite side of the net they are working on. Move the guideline down after completing each row. The lines will always hang in pairs and isolated persons always tie a cord from one pair to a cord from an adjoining pair. Continue tying rows until the net is the desired width. Thread a suspension line casing along the bottom of the net to strengthen it. Use the gill net as shown in figure 4-29. Angling the gill net will help to reduce the amount of debris that may accumulate in the net. Check it frequently.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/48.webp)

**Figure 4-29. Setting a gill net in a stream**

**Fish Traps**

4-158. There are several methods available for trapping fish to include fish baskets. Fish baskets are constructed by lashing several sticks together with vines into a funnel shape. The top is closed, leaving a hole large enough for the fish to swim through (see figure 4-30\).

**Figure 4-30. Various types of fish traps**

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/49.webp)

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/50.webp)

4-159. Fish traps can also be used to catch saltwater fish, as schools regularly approach the shore with the incoming tide and often move parallel to the shore. Pick a location at high tide and build the trap at low tide. On rocky shores, use natural rock pools. On coral islands, use natural pools on the surface of reefs by blocking the openings as the tide recedes. On sandy shores, use sandbars and the ditches they enclose. Build the trap as a low stall extending outward into the water and forming an angle with the shore.

4-160. Near shallow water (about waist deep) where fish are large and plentiful, they can be speared. To make a spear, cut a long, straight sapling. Sharpen the end to a point or attach a knife, a jagged piece of bone, or sharpened metal. A spear can also be made by splitting the shaft a few inches down from the end and inserting a piece of wood to act as a spreader, then sharpening the two separated halves to points (see figure 4-31 on page 4-41\).

4-161. To spear fish, find an area either where fish gather or where there is a fish run. Place the spear point into the water and slowly move it toward the fish. Then, with a sudden push, impale the fish on the stream bottom. Do not try to lift the fish with the spear, as it with probably slip off; hold the spear with one hand and grab and hold the fish with the other. Do not throw the spear, especially if the point is a knife. An isolated person cannot afford to lose a knife in a survival situation. Be alert to the problems caused by light refraction when looking at objects in the water. Aim lower than the object, usually at the bottom of the fish.

**Figure 4-31. Types of spear points**

4-162. At night, in an area with high fish density, use a light to attract fish. Then, armed with a machete or similar weapon, an isolated person can gather fish using the backside of the blade to strike them. Do not use the sharp side of the weapon as it will cut the fish in two pieces and one piece of the fish may be lost.

**Poison**

4-163. Poison may also be used to catch fish. Poison works quickly and allows an isolated person to remain concealed while it takes effect. It also enables an isolated person to catch several fish at one time. When using fish poison, be sure to gather all of the affected fish, because many dead fish floating downstream could arouse suspicion. Some plants that grow in warm regions of the world contain rotenone, a substance that stuns or kills cold-blooded animals but does not harm persons who eat the animals. The best place to use rotenone, or rotenone-producing plants, is in ponds or the headwaters of small streams containing fish. Rotenone works quickly on fish in water 70° F (21° C) or above. The fish rise helplessly to the surface. It works slowly in water 50 to 70° F (10 to 21° C) and is ineffective in water below 50° F (10° C). The following plants, used as indicated, will stun or kill fish (see figures 4-32a on page 4-42 and 4-32b, on page 4-43\):

- **Anamirta cocculus**. This woody vine grows in southern Asia and on islands of the South Pacific. Crush the bean-shaped seeds and throw them in the water.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/51.webp)

- **Croton tiglium**. This shrub or small tree grows in waste areas on islands of the South Pacific. It bears seeds in three angled capsules. Crush the seeds and throw them into the water.

- **Barringtonia**. These large trees grow near the sea in Malaya and parts of Polynesia. They bear a fleshy one-seeded fruit. Crush the seeds, bark, and throw them into the water.

- **Derris eliptica**. This large genus of tropical shrubs and woody vines is the main source of commercially produced rotenone. Grind the roots into a powder and mix with water. Throw a large quantity of the mixture into the water.

- **Duboisia**. This shrub grows in Australia and bears white clusters of flowers and berrylike fruit. Crush the plants and throw them into the water.

- **Tephrosia**. This species of small shrubs, which bears bean-like pods, grows throughout the tropics. Crush or bruise bundles of leaves and stems and throw them into the water.

- **Lime**. Lime can be acquired from commercial sources and in agricultural areas that use large quantities of it. It can also be produced burning coral or seashells. Throw the lime into the water.

- **Nut husks**. Crush green husks from butternuts or black walnuts. Throw the husks into the water.

## Preparing fish for consumption

4-164. Isolated persons must know how to prepare fish and game for cooking and storage in a survival situation. Improper cleaning or storage can result in inedible fish or game. Do not eat fish that appears spoiled. Cooking does not ensure that spoiled fish will be edible. Signs of spoilage include-

- Sunken eyes.

- Peculiar odor.

- Suspicious color. (Gills should be red to pink; scales should be a pronounced shade of gray, not faded.)

- Dents that stay in the fish's flesh after pressed with a thumb.

- Slimy, rather than moist or wet, body.

- Sharp or peppery taste.

4-165. Eating spoiled or rotten fish may cause diarrhea, nausea, cramps, vomiting, itching, paralysis, or a metallic taste in the mouth. These symptoms appear suddenly, one to six hours after eating. Induce vomiting if symptoms appear.

4-166. Fish spoils quickly after death, especially on a hot day. Prepare fish for eating as soon as possible after catching it. Cut out the gills and the large blood vessels that lie near the spine. Gut fish that are more than 4 inches long. Scale or skin the fish.

4-167. A whole fish can be impaled on a stick and cooked over an open fire. However, boiling the fish with the skin on is the best way to get the most food value. The fats and oil are under the skin and, by boiling, the juices can be saved for broth. Any of the methods used to cook plant food may also be used to cook fish. Pack fish into a ball of clay and bury it in the coals of a fire until the clay hardens. Break open the clay ball to get to the cooked fish. Fish is done when the meat flakes off. If fish is kept for later consumption, smoke or fry it. To prepare fish for smoking, cut off the head and remove the backbone.

**MOLLUSKS**

4-168. The mollusk class includes octopuses and freshwater and saltwater shellfish such as snails, clams, mussels, bivalves, barnacles, periwinkles, chitons, and sea urchins. Bivalves, similar to our freshwater mussel and terrestrial and aquatic snails, may be found worldwide under all water conditions. River snails or periwinkles are plentiful in rivers, streams, and lakes of northern coniferous forests. These snails may be pencil point or globular in shape. In fresh water, look for mollusks in the shallows, especially in water with a sandy or muddy bottom. Look for the narrow trails they leave in the mud or for the dark elliptical slit of

their open valves. Near the sea, look in the tidal pools and the wet sand. Rocks along beaches or extending as reefs into deeper water often bear clinging shellfish. Snails and limpets cling to rocks and seaweed from the low water mark upward. Large snails, called chitons, adhere tightly to rocks above the surf line. Snails are a good source of calcium, magnesium and vitamin C. Ensure snails are cooked thoroughly. Mussels usually form dense colonies in rock pools, on logs, or at the base of boulders. Steam, boil or bake mollusks in the shell. They make excellent stews in combination with greens and tubers (see figure 4-33 on page 4- 44\).

**Figure 4-33. Edible mollusks**

**CAUTION**

Mussels may be poisonous in tropical areas during the summers. If a noticeable red tide has occurred within 72 hours, do not eat any fish or shellfish from that water source. 

4-169. Do not eat shellfish not covered by water at high tide.

**CRUSTACEANS**

4-170. Freshwater shrimp range in size from 1/16 inch up to 1 inch. They can form rather large colonies in mats of floating algae or in mud bottoms of ponds and lakes.

4-171. Crayfish are akin to marine lobsters and crabs. Their hard exoskeleton and five pairs of legs-the front pair having oversized pincers-can distinguish them. Crayfish are active at night, but can be located in the daytime by looking under and around stones in streams. They can also be found by looking in the soft

mud near the chimney-like breathing holes of their nests. Crayfish can be caught by tying bits of offal or internal organs to a string. When the crayfish grabs the bait, pull it to shore before it has a chance to release the bait.

4-172. Saltwater lobsters, crabs, and shrimp can be found from the surf's edge out to water 33 feet deep. Shrimp may come to a light at night where they can be scooped up with a net. Lobsters and crabs can be caught with a baited trap or a baited hook. Crabs will come to bait placed at the edge of the surf where they can be trapped or netted. Lobsters and crabs are nocturnal and most easily caught at night.

**WARNING**

**All freshwater crustaceans, mollusks, and fish must be cooked. Fresh water tends to harbor many dangerous organisms, animal and human contaminants, and possibly agricultural and industrial pollutants.**
