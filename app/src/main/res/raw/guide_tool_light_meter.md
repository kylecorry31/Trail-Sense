The Light Meter tool measures a flashlight's beam distance, which is how far it can project usable light.

## Testing Flashlight Beam Distance
To measure a flashlight's beam distance:

1. Go into a dark room.
2. Place your phone on the floor, screen up.
3. Enter the distance you will hold the flashlight from the phone (ex. 3 feet / 1 meter).
4. Holding the flashlight at the set distance, point it at the phone screen and turn it on.
5. Move the flashlight around while maintaining the set distance and keeping it pointed at your phone.
6. Once the reading stops changing, the beam distance has been determined.
7. You can click 'Reset' to test another flashlight.

## Choosing an Appropriate Beam Distance
The beam distance you need depends on how you will use the flashlight:
- For camping, a shorter beam lets you see your immediate surroundings.
- For hiking, a longer beam lets you see farther ahead - try starting with 300 feet (100 meters).
