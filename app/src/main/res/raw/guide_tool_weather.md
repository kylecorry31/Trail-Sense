The Weather tool can be used to roughly predict the weather.

## Weather Prediction
The weather prediction appears at the top of your screen. This does not use the Internet and factors in pressure history, historical (30-year average) temperatures, and the clouds from the Clouds tool. It also attempts to estimate when the weather change will occur, displayed beneath the prediction. The accuracy of the time frame depends on if the clouds indicate a weather front; if it's detected, an approximate time will be displayed, otherwise, it's more vague, like "soon" or "later."

If the Weather Monitor is on, it records pressure history automatically. Otherwise, pressure updates only occur when you open the Weather tool. For accuracy, it's best to record pressure every 30 minutes.

## Weather Monitor
The Weather Monitor runs in the background to record pressure history. Enable it by clicking the start icon at the bottom right. This causes a notification to appear with the current prediction and an option to stop the Weather Monitor. You can also stop it by clicking the stop icon in the bottom right.

To change the recording frequency, click the time under the Weather Monitor label at the bottom left and enter a new interval.

For better accuracy, grant Trail Sense Location permission to determine your elevation via GPS. This helps convert pressure to sea level pressure, improving prediction accuracy.

You can also enable daily weather notifications in Settings > Weather > Daily weather notification. Without the Weather Monitor being active, you won't receive these notifications.

## Storm Alert
If the Weather Monitor is active, Trail Sense can notify you when a storm is detected. Enable this in Settings > Weather > Storm Alert.

## Weather Details
The Weather tool also provides more information about the current and predicted weather.

### Alerts
The Weather tool displays alerts when a storm is detected or historical temperatures suggest hot or cold conditions.

### Pressure
A pressure history chart is displayed at the top of the screen. Falling pressure may indicate an incoming storm, rising pressure suggests clearing weather, and steady pressure indicates no significant changes. The current pressure and its tendency (change over time) are listed below the chart.

The current pressure system is also displayed. Low pressure often means poor weather, while high pressure indicates fair conditions. Clicking on it provides a description of the pressure system.

### Temperature
The current temperature, sourced from historical data or the onboard thermometer, is shown in the weather list. Daily high/low temperatures are also provided using historical data. Clicking on the current temperature reveals a temperature history chart, while clicking on high/low temperatures displays a 24-hour temperature prediction chart based on historical temperatures.

### Humidity
If your device has a humidity sensor, the current humidity is displayed. Clicking on it reveals a humidity history chart.

### Clouds
The last logged cloud type appears in the weather list. Clicking on it provides a description of the cloud type.

### Weather Front
The current weather front is displayed in the weather list. Fronts typically indicate weather changes and are often associated with precipitation and wind. Clicking on it provides a description of the weather front.

## Quick Action
The Weather Monitor quick action is available on the Weather and Tools tabs. You can enable the quick action in the settings for the tab you want it on.

To use the quick action, tap the Weather Monitor quick action button to toggle it on or off.

## Settings
Settings for the Weather tool can be found in Settings > Weather.

- **Left quick action**: The quick action that appears in the top left.
- **Right quick action**: The quick action that appears in the top right.
- **Monitor Weather**: Enables the Weather Monitor.
- **Storm alerts**: Enables storm alerts.
- **Storm sensitivity**: The sensitivity of storm alerts. A higher value means more storms will be detected, but may also result in false alerts.
- **Forecast sensitivity**: The sensitivity of the weather forecast. A higher value means more weather patterns will be detected, but may also result in false predictions.
- **Notifications (Weather Monitor)**: Links to Android's notification settings for Trail Sense.
- **Show pressure in notification**: Displays the current pressure in the Weather Monitor notification.
- **Show temperature in notification**: Displays the current temperature in the Weather Monitor notification.
- **Daily weather notification**: Enables daily weather notifications.
- **Daily weather time**: The approximate time of day to send the daily weather notification.
- **Weather update frequency**: The frequency of pressure updates when the Weather Monitor is active.
- **Show colored notification icon**: Displays the forecast icon in color when you view the notification.
- **Export weather records**: Exports weather records to a CSV file.

## Accuracy
The weather prediction is a best guess using available sensor data, and may not be accurate. If Trail Sense says it is going to be clear but you see what appears to be storm clouds rolling in, trust your instincts - some times storms roll in with gradual changes in pressure. Seek shelter if you sense a storm approaching, regardless of Trail Sense's prediction.

Climate normals (historic temperatures) are based on the 30 year average of the historic data, and indicate what the weather usually is. The actual values may differ for a variety of reasons, but should remain fairly close to the historic values. Large differences are normally due to a storm or other weather event.

Historic temperatures are estimated using a custom 30 year "climate normal" model derived from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office - MERRA-2 data (1991 - 2020).
