The Temperature Estimation tool can be used to estimate the temperature at a different elevation.

# Estimating Temperature
To estimate the temperature at another elevation, you need to know your current elevation and the current temperature, as well as the elevation you want to estimate the temperature at.

To estimate the temperature:

1. Either click 'Autofill' or enter the 'Base elevation' (your elevation) and 'Base temperature' (the temperature at your location).
2. Then enter the 'Desired elevation' (the elevation you want to estimate the temperature at).
3. The estimated temperature will be shown at the top of the screen.
