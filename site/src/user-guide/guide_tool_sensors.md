The Sensors tool can be used to test the sensors on your device.

## Sensor list
The sensor list shows all the sensors available on your device that Trail Sense uses. If the accuracy of the sensor is available, it will be shown on the left, and the sensor's value will appear to the right of that.

## All sensors
To see all available sensors on your device, click the button in the top-right corner of the screen. This will show a list of all sensors available on your device, including those that Trail Sense does not use.
