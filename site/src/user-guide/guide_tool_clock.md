The Clock tool can be used to determine the current time using the GPS satellites.

## Viewing GPS time
When you first open the Clock tool, it shows your device's set time. Once you get a GPS fix, the clock automatically updates to show precise GPS time. To refresh the GPS time, tap the refresh icon in the top-left.

## Syncing Your Clock
To sync your device’s clock with GPS time:

1. Tap 'Update system time'.
2. Note the time shown in the pop-up.
3. Tap 'OK' to open your device's time settings.
4. Enter the noted time and wait for the sync notification before saving.
5. Save the time update when the notification arrives.
6. Your system time is now synced with GPS time.

## Digital clock
If you prefer a digital clock, you can switch to it by turning off the 'Analog clock' setting in the Clock tool's settings. This will show a large digital clock on the screen.
