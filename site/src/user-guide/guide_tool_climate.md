title: "Climate"

The Climate tool displays historical climate data for a given location.

## Temperature
The historical high and low temperatures are displayed at the top of the screen for the selected date. The chart also displays high temperatures as a red line and the low temperatures as a blue line.

The freezing point is displayed in the bottom portion of the chart as a filled area.

## Precipitation
The historical monthly precipitation totals for your selected location are also shown. Be extra cautious when creating campfires during dry seasons.

## Climate classification
The climate for your current location is classified based on temperatures and precipitation. Different climates have different vegetation types as well as unique hazards that you should be aware of. 

## Changing the date
To change the date, you can tap the calendar icon above the chart and select a date. Additionally, you can use the arrows to move to the next/previous date or long press the calendar to quickly jump to today's date.

Tapping on one of the lines on the chart will also change the date to the point you tapped.

## Changing the location
By default, your current location is used. If you want to change this, enter a new location in the input field below the chart. You can also change the elevation using the elevation input field.

## Accuracy
Climate normals are based on the 30-year average of the historical data and indicate what the weather usually is. The actual values may differ for a variety of reasons but should remain fairly close to the historical values. Large differences are normally due to a storm or other weather event.

Historic temperatures and precipitation are estimated using a custom 30-year "climate normal" model derived from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office - MERRA-2 and ERA5 data respectively (1991 - 2020).
