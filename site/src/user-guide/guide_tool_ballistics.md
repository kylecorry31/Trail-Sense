title: "Ballistics"
---

The Ballistics tool provides calculators for firearms to help hunters make a shot. Remember to always treat your firearm as if it were loaded and practice safe handling to avoid injury. Be sure to follow local laws and regulations at all times.

## Scope
You can use the Scope calculator to sight in a scope. It is best to take a few shots and measure to the center of the group. Do not change the point where you are aiming between shots.

- **Adjustment per click**: This is normally found on your scope's dials. If your scope lists inches per 100 yards, that is equivalent to MOA (1/4" @ 100 yd = 1/4 MOA).
- **Distance to target**: The distance to the target you are sighting your scope for.
- **Windage miss**: The amount your shot group missed the point of aim to either the left or right.
- **Elevation miss**: The amount your shot group missed the point of aim either above or below.

Once you fill out the fields, the scope adjustment amount will be shown at the bottom. The adjustment per click and distance to target will be remembered.

## Ballistics
This feature is experimental and can be enabled via experimental settings. The accuracy has not been fully verified and does not exactly match other calculators yet.

You can use the Ballistics calculator to determine bullet drop at a given distance.

- **Sight-in range**: The distance you sighted in your rifle at.
- **Scope height**: The height of your scope above the center of the bore.
- **Muzzle velocity**: The speed of the bullet as it leaves the muzzle. This can normally be found on the ammo box, looked up online, or measured with a chronograph.
- **Ballistic coefficient**: The ballistic coefficient of the bullet. This can normally be found on the ammo box or looked up online. If you don't provide this, then drag will not be factored in.

Once you enter the above fields, a table will display containing the time, range, velocity, and drop. All fields will be remembered.

## Energy
You can use the Energy calculator to determine how much energy your projectile will impact with. You should ensure the energy of your bullet is sufficient for the animal you plan to hunt.

- **Muzzle velocity**: The speed of the bullet as it leaves the muzzle. This can normally be found on the ammo box, looked up online, or measured with a chronograph.
- **Bullet weight**: The weight of the bullet. This can normally be found on the ammo box, looked up online, or measured with a scale.

Once you enter the above fields, the energy will be displayed at the bottom. Check with local laws, regulations, and ethics guidelines to determine the minimum energy for a legal and ethical hunt. All fields will be remembered.
