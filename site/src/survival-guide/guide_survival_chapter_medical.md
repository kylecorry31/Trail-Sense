- Descend to a lower altitude if symptoms are severe or do not improve within a day.

### Prevention

- Ascend slowly.
- Acclimate before ascending further.
- Watch for symptoms above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).

## Bites, stings, and attacks

### Animals
<!-- K: bite, attack, animal, mammal, bell, fight, pepper-spray, bear -->
<!-- S: Treat by washing the wound with soap and water, applying antibiotics, bandaging, and seeking medical attention. Prevent this by avoiding wild animals and making noise to alert them of your presence. -->

Many animals bite when threatened and some can transmit diseases.

#### Treatment

1. Wash the wound with soap and water.
2. Apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Cover the wound with a bandage. Pack deep wounds with gauze but do not suture or tape them closed.
4. Seek medical attention if the wound is deep, bleeding, or shows signs of infection.

If a mammal bit you, seek medical attention as soon as possible; you may need rabies shots.

#### Prevention

- Do not approach, corner, or feed wild animals.
- Use a bear bell or make noise to alert animals.
- Avoid animals with young nearby.
- If approached by an animal:
  - Don't run, as this may trigger a chase.
  - Make yourself look big.
  - Make noise (not high-pitched screaming).
  - Pick up children and pets.
  - Back away slowly or move sideways.
  - Use bear or pepper spray if available.
  - Fight back if attacked, except by grizzlies.
    - Aim for eyes, nose, or throat with rocks, sticks, or hands.
    - If a **grizzly** attacks, play dead unless it stalks you, attacks in your tent, or continues attacking - then fight back.
  - Keep your backpack on; it can offer protection.

### Leeches
<!-- K: leech, bite, suck, blood, remove -->
<!-- S: Treat by removing the leech with a fingernail or flat object and cleaning the area. Prevent this by using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants. -->

Leeches attach to your skin and suck your blood. They can be found in freshwater lakes, ponds, and marshes.

#### Symptoms

- Leech attached to the skin.
- Bleeding.
- Swelling.
- Pain.

#### Treatment

1. Pull it taut (but not too tight).
2. Slide a fingernail or other flat object between the leech and your skin to detach it.
3. Flick the leech away before it can reattach.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.
5. Apply a bandage to control bleeding. It is normal for the wound to bleed for a while.

Do not salt, burn, or pull the leech off, as this can cause it to regurgitate into the wound.

#### Prevention

- Use insect repellent.
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Check for leeches frequently.

### Snakes
<!-- K: snake, bite, venom, poison, antivenom, snakebite -->
<!-- S: Treat by cleaning the wound, applying a bandage, immobilizing the limb, and seeking medical attention. Prevent this by watching where you step and wearing high boots. -->

Always look for snakes, especially in areas with tall grass, rocks, or logs. Snakes are most active during the day. Most snake bites are not venomous, but if you don't know the type of snake, treat the bite as venomous.

#### Treatment

1. Rinse the bite area with water.
2. Clean the wound and cover with a bandage.
3. Remove any rings or jewelry from the affected limb.
4. Wrap the limb with a bandage, starting at the bite and moving up the limb. The bandage should be tight but not cut off circulation. You should be able to slip a finger under the bandage. If you are bitten by a pit viper (like a rattlesnake), do not bandage or apply compression as this can lead to increased tissue damage.
5. Keep the limb immobilized, as you would a fracture, and below the level of the heart.
6. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Call the hospital ahead of time so they can prepare antivenom if needed.

Do not do the following:

- Cut the wound.
- Suck out the venom.
- Apply a tourniquet.
- Apply ice.

#### Prevention

- Watch where you step.
- Wear high boots.
- Do not put your hands or feet where you cannot see.
- Do not try to catch or kill snakes unless you know they are not venomous.

### Insects, spiders, and scorpions
<!-- K: bug, bite, repel, spray, sting, insect, spider, scorpion, mosquito, ant, bee, wasp, hornet, fly, itch, swell, red, remove -->
<!-- S: Treat by removing the stinger/tick/leech, cleaning the area, and, if needed, seeking medical attention. Prevent this by using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants. -->

Many insects can bite or sting you, causing pain, swelling, and itching. Some insects can also transmit diseases.

#### Symptoms

- Itching.
- Swelling.
- Redness.
- Pain.

#### Treatment

**Bites**

To reduce itching, avoid scratching and apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream. To reduce swelling, use a cloth soaked in cold water or filled with snow/ice.

If you were bitten by a spider you believe to be venomous, treat it as you would a snake bite and seek medical attention.

**Stings**

Remove any stingers, taking care not to squeeze the venom sac. Treat it as if it were a bug bite.

If you were stung by a scorpion or insect you believe to be venomous, treat it as a snake bite and seek medical attention.

**Bugs in eyes**

See the section on objects in the eye.

#### Prevention

- Use insect repellent.
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Wrap your face with a bandana.
- Wear glasses/sunglasses (to keep bugs out of your eyes).
- Use a bug net.
- Ensure your immunizations are current for bug-borne diseases in the area.

You can make an improvised bug repellent by applying mud to your skin or using fire smoke.

### Ticks
<!-- K: bite, repel, spray, tick, itch, swell, red, remove -->
<!-- S: Treat by removing the tick, cleaning the area, and, if needed, seeking medical attention. Prevent this by using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants. -->

Ticks attach to your skin and will feed on your blood. They can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

#### Symptoms

- Itching.
- Swelling.
- Redness.
- Attached tick.

#### Treatment

1. Using tweezers if available, grasp the tick where it is attached to the skin.
2. Pull straight out with steady, even pressure. Do not twist or jerk the tick. Do not squeeze the tick's body.
3. Treat the area as you would for a bug bite.

#### Prevention

- Use insect repellent.
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Check for ticks frequently.

### Jellyfish
<!-- K: jellyfish, sting, tentacle -->
<!-- S: Treat by removing tentacles, rinsing with seawater, and applying heat. Prevent this by avoiding jellyfish. -->

Many jellyfish have small, venomous stinging cells, typically on tentacles. Even dead jellyfish can sting.

#### Symptoms

- Pain.
- Itching.
- Redness.
- Rash.
- Swelling.

#### Treatment

1. Rub sand on the area to remove the stingers, but be sure to use a barrier of seaweed or cloth over your hands to avoid getting stung there as well. You can also use the edge of a credit card or tweezers to remove the stingers.
2. Rinse the area with seawater (or vinegar if you somehow have it on you). Do not rinse with fresh water, as this can cause the stingers to release more venom.
3. Soak the area in hot water for 30 minutes.
4. Take pain relievers if needed.

## Bleeding
<!-- K: bleed, blood, wound, cut, scrape, deep, clot, pressure, tourniquet, bandage, red, swell, warm, pus -->
<!-- S: Treat by applying pressure, cleaning the wound, bandaging, and, if needed, seek medical attention. Prevent infection by cleaning wounds and changing bandages frequently. -->

### Treatment
Seek medical attention if the wound is deep, bleeding profusely, or shows signs of infection. Infected wounds can be identified by redness, swelling, warmth, and pus.

**Scrapes and minor cuts**

1. Clean the wound with water.
2. Optionally, apply antibiotic ointment.
3. Apply a bandage. You can use medical grade superglue if needed.

**Deeper cuts**

1. Apply pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage. You may need to apply pressure for about 10 to 20 minutes.
2. Clean the wound and irrigate it with water.
3. Bandage the wound with a sterile dressing.
4. Place new bandages over the old ones if they become soaked with blood.
5. Raise the wound above the level of the heart.
6. Seek medical attention if bleeding does not stop or if the wound is deep.

You can apply a tourniquet to stop blood flow if direct pressure does not work on a limb. This should only be done as a last resort, as it can cause permanent damage. Only a medical professional should remove a tourniquet.

### Prevention

- Use caution when handling sharp objects.
- Do not cut toward yourself.
- Watch your footing.
- To prevent infection:
  - Clean wounds.
  - Use antibiotic ointment.
  - Change bandages frequently.

## Blisters
<!-- K: blister, rub, shoe, sock, moleskin, red, sore -->
<!-- S: Treat small blisters by applying moleskin and large blisters by draining with a sterilized needle, cleaning, and bandaging. Preventing this by keeping feet dry and wearing properly fitting shoes. -->

This is about the level of a mild sunburn.

1. Soak with cool water for 5 minutes.
2. Optionally, take pain relievers.
3. Apply aloe vera gel, calamine lotion, or hydrocortisone cream.

**Second-degree burns**
This is a burn that blisters and can be very painful. 

1. Soak with cool water for at least 15 minutes.
2. Take pain relievers.
3. Pat the area dry.
4. Apply a loose bandage.

Do not pop blisters.

**Third-degree burns**
This is a burn that goes through all layers of skin and may be life-threatening. Pain may be minimal due to nerve damage. Second-degree burns are likely also present.

1. Call emergency services.
2. Soak with cool water.
3. Remove clothing and jewelry from the area.

## Embedded fishhooks
<!-- K: fishhook, hook, remove -->
<!-- S: Hooks can be removed by running a line through the bend and pulling quickly while pushing down on the hook. Prevent by handling hooks with care. -->

Fishhooks are designed to penetrate flesh and are difficult to remove without causing further injury. Unless you need to remove the hook to prevent further injury, it's best to leave the hook in place and seek medical attention.

### Treatment
Do not attempt to remove a fishhook if it is embedded in the eye.

**Method 1**

1. Advance the hook through the skin until the barb is exposed.
2. Cut the barb off with wire cutters like those on a multitool or pliers.
3. Pull the hook opposite from how it entered; it should come out easily.
4. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

**Method 2**

1. Run a fishing line or cordage through the bend of the hook.
2. Grab the ends of the string.
3. Apply downward pressure on the eye of the hook.
4. Quickly pull the string, causing the hook to come out the way it went in.
5. Clean the wound and apply antibiotic ointment.

- Use a barbless hook if possible (these don't work as well when fishing).

## Fractures
<!-- K: fracture, break, broken, bone, pain, swelling, bruise, deform, weight, splint, sling, set, arm, leg -->
<!-- S: Treat by splinting and seeking medical attention. Prevent this by being cautious and wearing proper footwear. -->

A fracture is a broken bone. A fracture can be closed (bone is broken, but skin is intact) or open (bone is broken and protruding from the skin).

### Symptoms

- Pain.
- Swelling.
- Bruising.
- Deformity.
- Loss of function.
- Inability to bear weight.

### Treatment
If the bone is out of place and medical attention is unavailable for several hours, you may need to set it. Otherwise, splint it in place and seek medical attention.

**Setting a bone**

1. Irrigate and clean the wound if the bone is protruding.
2. Grab the limb below the fracture.
3. Pull the limb to straighten the bone. It may pop into place, and pain may decrease.
4. Splint the bone while holding it in place.
5. Cover the open wound with a sterile dressing and bandage.

**Splinting a bone**

1. Remove all jewelry and tight clothing from the area.
2. Apply padding around the fracture.
3. Construct a splint using a rigid object (stick, trekking pole, tent pole). It should extend past the bone break on both sides.
4. Secure the splint with bandages, tape, or cordage. It should be tight but not cut off circulation. If splinting a finger, tape it to the one next to it.
5. Apply a sling if the fracture is in the arm to help immobilize the limb.

## Objects in the eye
<!-- K: eye, object, something, bug -->
<!-- S: Treat by irrigating the eye with clean water and removing the object with a damp cloth or cotton swab. Prevent by wearing glasses or sunglasses. -->

It is common to get objects in your eye while in the wilderness, such as dirt, sand, bugs, or an eyelash.

### Symptoms

- Pain and discomfort of the eye.
- Redness of the eye.
- Excess tearing.
- Difficulty keeping the eye open.

### Treatment

1. Avoid rubbing the eye.
2. Using clean water, irrigate the eye by pouring water into the eye.
3. If the object is still in the eye, use a mirror to locate it and attempt to remove it using a damp cloth or cotton swab. Be very gentle.
4. If the object is under the upper eyelid and you have a partner, have them place the tip of a cotton swab in the middle of your upper eyelid and gently fold the eyelid over the cotton swab. They can then remove the object using a damp cloth or cotton swab.
5. After the object is removed, if the eye feels scratchy, place a cold, damp cloth over it, keep the eye closed and rest, use eye drops, or construct an eye patch using a bandage or cloth.
6. Seek medical attention if the object is not removed or symptoms persist.

### Prevention

- Wear glasses or sunglasses.
- Don't lift objects with dirt on them above your head without eye protection.

<!-- S: Symptoms include a rash, itching, and blisters. Treat by washing the area with soap and water, applying calamine lotion, and taking antihistamines. Prevent by learning to identify and avoid poisonous plants. -->

Contact dermatitis is caused by contact with poisonous plants, such as poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and stinging nettle.

![](/assets/images/survival_guide/dangerous_plants.webp)

1. **Poison ivy**: A toxic plant with three glossy, pointed leaflets, commonly found in forests, fields, and along trails. Contact with its oil causes itchy rashes and skin irritation.
2. **Stinging nettle**: A plant with serrated leaves and tiny stinging hairs, commonly found in moist, shaded areas. Contact causes a painful, itchy rash.

### Symptoms

- Burning, reddening, and swelling rash
- Itching
- Blisters

### Treatment

1. Try to remove oil from the plant using soap and water. Sand or dirt can be used as a substitute unless there are blisters.
2. Dry the area.
3. Apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to reduce the itch. If unavailable, apply a tannic acid solution (boil acorns or oak bark in water) or crushed jewelweed.
4. Optionally, take antihistamine pills to reduce itching.

If you touched stinging nettle, apply mud to the area and remove it when it dries. You can also use tape to pull the small needles out.

Avoid scratching the rash, as it can cause infection. Leave blisters alone.

### Prevention
Learn to identify and avoid contact with the following plants:

- Cowhage
- Poison ivy
- Poison oak
- Poison sumac
- Rengas tree
- Trumpet vine
- Stinging nettle

If you come into contact with these plants, wash the area with soap and water as soon as possible. Do not wait for a rash to appear. Do not burn these plants, as the smoke can cause irritation.

## Sleeping
<!-- K: sleep, asleep, rest, nap -->
<!-- S: To fall asleep you should calm your mind, ensure you aren't too hot or cold, and use comfortable bedding. -->

Falling asleep can be difficult in the wilderness, but getting adequate rest is important for maintaining energy. To help yourself fall asleep, wind down at night by avoiding strenuous activity and calming your mind, perhaps using meditation. Ensure you aren't too hot or cold and that your sleeping area is comfortable. You might find it easier to sleep if you make a pillow by stuffing spare clothing or a stuff sack with dry leaves or other soft materials.

Some people may also find it necessary to block out noise using earplugs or listening to music or white noise if available.

## Snow blindness
<!-- K: snow, blind, eye, headache, light, sensitivity, red, scratchy, itch, uv -->
<!-- S: Symptoms include red, scratchy, and watery eyes, sensitivity to light, and headache. Treat by covering your eyes with a dark cloth. Prevent by wearing UV-protective sunglasses or snow goggles. -->

Snow blindness is caused when too much sunlight reflects off snow, ice, or water into your eyes.

### Symptoms

- Eyes are red, scratchy, and watery.
- Sensitivity to light.
- Headache.

### Treatment
Cover your eyes with a dark cloth until symptoms disappear.

### Prevention
Wear UV-protective sunglasses or snow goggles. If you do not have these, you can make snow goggles from a piece of cloth or a piece of bark with slits cut in it. You can also put soot under your eyes to reduce glare.

## Splinters, thorns, spines, and needles
<!-- K: splinter, thorn, wood, needle, spike, spine, remove, tweezers, hand, porcupine, urchin, cactus -->
<!-- S: Treat by removing the splinter with tweezers and cleaning the area. Prevent by using caution when handling dry wood or thorn bushes. -->

Splinters and thorns can be painful and may lead to infection if not removed.

### Treatment
If the splinter is deep or very large, seek medical attention and do not try to remove it yourself.

1. Inspect the splinter to see if any part is exposed and determine which direction it entered.
2. If no part is exposed, sterilize a needle using hand sanitizer or a flame and gently use it to expose one end of the splinter.
3. Use tweezers to grab the exposed end of the splinter, preferably pulling in the opposite direction from how it entered.
4. Slowly pull the splinter out.
5. Repeat if any pieces remain.
6. If the splinter drew blood when removed, treat it as a cut. Applying antibiotic ointment and a bandage won't hurt.

Thorns, spines, and needles can be removed the same way as splinters. Some thorns may be easy to remove without tweezers.

For urchin spines, soak the area in hot (not scalding) water for 10 to 90 minutes before removal.

### Prevention

- Use caution when handling dry wood or thorn bushes.
- Avoid walking through thorn bushes.
- Wear long sleeves and pants if going off trail.
- Don't touch cacti or porcupines.
- Watch out for urchins if walking in the ocean.
