The Clouds tool assists you in tracking and predicting weather patterns by identifying clouds. If your phone is equipped with a barometer, Trail Sense can merge cloud observations with barometer readings to enhance weather prediction on the Weather tool.

## Cloud log
In the cloud log, you'll find the last 48 hours of cloud observations. Each row includes the observation time, cloud type, and potential weather indications. Click on a row for more details about the cloud, including its description, possible weather outcomes, precipitation chances, and common precipitation types it can generate. To delete an observation, use the menu button located on the right of each row. Additionally, you can click on the cloud image to view a larger version.

## Logging a cloud
To log a cloud, tap the '+' button at the bottom-right. You can choose to use a picture of the cloud from your device's files or camera, or manually identify the cloud.

### Automatic identification
If you opt to use the camera or a file, Trail Sense will make an attempt to identify the cloud for you. It will display its confidence in each cloud type and allow you to select the cloud types you wish to log using the checkboxes. By default, it selects the most likely cloud type(s). You can also adjust the observation time by clicking on the time at the top of the screen. Once you're satisfied with the observation, click the checkmark button at the top-right of the screen.

### Manual identification
If you choose to manually identify the cloud, you will see a list of cloud types. Use the checkboxes to select the cloud types you want to log. You can also adjust the observation time by clicking on the time at the top of the screen. Once you're satisfied with the observation, click the checkmark button at the top-right of the screen.

## Quick action
You can enable the Cloud Scanner quick action in the settings for the tab where you want it to appear.

Tapping the quick action button will open your camera to take a picture of a cloud to identify. Long pressing the button will open the Clouds tool.
