The Flashlight tool can be used to provide light or signal for help. As with any tool in Trail Sense, it is always best to carry a real flashlight with you.

## Flashlight
Tap the flashlight button to toggle the flashlight on or off. When the flashlight is on (in any mode), a notification will be displayed to allow you to quickly turn it off.

On supported devices, you can adjust the brightness using the slider at the bottom.

## Strobe
Drag the dial to the desired strobe frequency. Tap the flashlight button to toggle the strobe on or off.

Please note that the strobe feature contains flashing lights, which may be dangerous for some users. Prolonged use of the strobe may cause excess battery drain or damage to your camera's flash.

## SOS
Drag the dial to the SOS indicator to continuously play the SOS distress signal (3 short, 3 long, 3 short). Tap the flashlight button to toggle the SOS on or off.

## Screen
You can use your screen as a flashlight, which may be better for close-up work. Tap the screen button to start. From there, you can adjust the brightness using the slider at the bottom, and toggle the color between red (preserves night vision) and white (brighter) using the button at the top.

Press back or tap the 'Turn off' button to turn off the screen flashlight. Your settings will be saved for next time.

You can choose to control the brightness of the screen flashlight by enabling 'Settings > Flashlight > Control screen flashlight brightness with volume buttons'.

## Automatically turn off
You can set the flashlight to automatically turn off after a certain amount of time by enabling 'Settings > Flashlight > Automatically turn off' and selecting the desired time. This can be useful to save battery if you forget to turn off the flashlight.

## Toggle with volume buttons
You can set the flashlight to toggle on or off when you press either volume button by enabling 'Settings > Flashlight > Toggle with volume buttons'. This only works while Trail Sense is open.
