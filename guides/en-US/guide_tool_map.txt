The Map tool can be used to display your beacons, paths, and photo maps in a single place. It's essential to always carry a physical map as a backup and validate Trail Sense's accuracy. This is not a replacement for a dedicated maps app and it will only show maps that you have loaded into the Photo Maps tool.

## Using the map
You can drag to pan, pinch to zoom, or tap the zoom buttons in the bottom-right.

Click the GPS button in the bottom-right to center the map on your location. Clicking it again will lock both your location and orientation, while a final click unlocks it.

## Changing time
If you have a time dependent layer enabled (like tides or solar eclipse), a clock button will appear in the top-right corner. Click it to change the time used for these layers. The map will update to reflect the selected time. Click the button again to reset to the current time.

## Navigating and creating beacons
When navigating to a beacon, the distance, direction, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) are displayed at the bottom. To cancel navigation, click the 'X' button. You can open the beacon by tapping the beacon name in the navigation sheet.

You can initiate navigation from the map by tapping a beacon or long-pressing a map point and selecting 'Navigate'.

To create a beacon from the map, long-press a map point and choose 'Beacon.' This opens the 'Create Beacon' screen with the location filled in.

For further details on beacons, refer to the 'Beacons' guide.

## Measuring distance and creating paths
You can measure distances by clicking the menu button in the top-right, and selecting 'Measure' or 'Create path'. Tap the map to place markers, and the total distance will be displayed at the bottom. To undo the last marker, click the undo button in the bottom left. Cancel by clicking the 'X' button in the bottom-right. You can also convert the drawn path into a saved path by clicking the 'Create path' button at the bottom.

For a quick measurement from your location to a point, long-press that point on the map and click 'Distance'.

## Measuring elevation
Long press a location on the map to view the elevation (from the DEM).

## Layers
Layers are used to display information on the map. For more information on layers, refer to the 'Map Layers' guide.
