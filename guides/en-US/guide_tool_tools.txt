Trail Sense is composed of a number of tools that are designed for hiking, backpacking, camping, and geocaching.

## Bottom navigation
The Navigation, Weather (if available), and Astronomy tools are available in the bottom navigation bar by default. These tools are also available in the tool list.

You can change which tools (up to 7) appear in the bottom navigation in Settings > Tools > 'Bottom navigation slot'.

All other tools can be found in the Tools bottom navigation item on the far right.

## Tool list
The tool list can be accessed by tapping the Tools item in the bottom navigation bar. This will show a list of all tools available in Trail Sense.

Clicking on a tool will open it.

You can also long-press on a tool to see more options:
- **About**: Provides more details about what the tool does.
- **Pin/unpin**: Allows you to pin the tool to the top of the list.
- **User guide**: Opens the user guide for the tool.
- **Settings**: Opens the settings for the tool.
- **Experimental**: This will show tools that are still in development. These tools may not be fully functional. You can enable experimental tools in Settings > Experimental.

## Pinned tools
You can pin tools to the top of the tool list by long-pressing on a tool and selecting 'Pin'. This will make the tool appear at the top of the tool list. You can unpin a tool by long-pressing on it and selecting 'Unpin'.

You can also pin/unpin tools in bulk by tapping the edit icon to the right of the pinned tools header.

## Sorting tools
You can change the order of the tools by clicking the sort icon to the right of the tools header. This will allow you to sort by:
- **Name**: Sorts alphabetically by tool name.
- **Category**: Groups tools by category and sorts alphabetically within each category.

## Search
You can search for a specific tool using the search bar at the top of the tool list. 

## User guide
A user guide is available for each tool. You can access the user guide by long-pressing on a tool and selecting 'User Guide'. You can also access the user guide by opening the 'User Guide' tool in the tool list.

## Settings
You can access the app settings by tapping the settings icon in the top right corner of the tool list. You can also access the settings by opening the 'Settings' tool in the tool list.

## Quick actions
You can enable quick actions at the top of the tool list in 'Settings > Tools > Quick actions'.

The quick actions can also be accessed by long pressing the bottom navigation. In addition to the quick actions you selected, you will also see contextual quick actions for the active tool, such as the user guide or settings.

You can find more information about each quick action by viewing the user guide for its respective tool. All quick actions that begin with 'Tool:' will open the tool when clicked.

## In-app widgets
In-app widgets can be accessed by long pressing the bottom navigation and changing to the "Widgets" tab. For the most part, these are the same widgets that you can place on your device's homescreen.
