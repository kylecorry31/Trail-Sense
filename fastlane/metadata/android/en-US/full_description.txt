<p>Trail Sense is a tool, and just like any other tool that you bring into the wilderness,
it's essential to have backup equipment and skills.
This app is intended for information purposes only and the accuracy of the predictions and sensors are determined by a number of factors, including calibration, sensor quality, external sources, etc.
Use at your own risk, always have backup tools (ex. compass), and stay safe.</p>

<p>This app also does not, and will never, use the Internet - all information in Trail Sense comes directly from your phone's sensors, and no data will leave Trail Sense.</p>

<h3>COMMON ISSUES</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No compass: If your phone does not have a compass sensor, there is nothing I can do to make it work because that is hardware.
    You will still be able to use other features of Trail Sense.</li>
    <li>No weather: The Weather tool is only available if your phone has a barometer sensor.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm the only developer of Trail Sense, so I will do my best to help out with issues - but I have a limited device selection to test on.</p>
