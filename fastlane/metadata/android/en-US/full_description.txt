<p>Explore beyond the reaches of the Internet with Trail Sense.</p>

<p>Trail Sense is an app that uses your phone's sensors to help you on wilderness treks. Trail Sense contains many tools that can be used in different scenarios, such as hiking, camping, backpacking, rock climbing, etc.</p>

<p>This app also does not, and will never, use the Internet - all information in Trail Sense comes directly from your phone's sensors, and no data will leave Trail Sense.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Designed for hiking, backpacking, camping, and geocaching</li>
    <li>Place beacons and navigate to them</li>
    <li>Follow paths</li>
    <li>Retrace your steps with backtrack</li>
    <li>Plan what to pack</li>
    <li>Be alerted before the sun sets</li>
    <li>Predict the weather</li>
    <li>Use your phone as a flashlight</li>
    <li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Trail Sense is a tool that you can use, but not something you should rely on. This app is intended for information purposes only and the accuracy of the predictions and sensors are determined by a number of factors, including calibration, sensor quality, external sources, etc. Use at your own risk, always have backup tools (ex. compass), and stay safe as much as possible.</p>
